<p id="p07_cap"><span class="hidden">T</span>HERE was once a boy named Billy, who spent a
summer in the woods with Somebody.</p>

<p>Somebody had expected to have a wonderful time
telling him stories; but it turned out that the boy named
Billy did not care for made up stories. He would listen, if
they were sufficiently exciting, but even stories of wolves
and bears and tigers were not very much worth while unless
they were <em>really so</em>.</p>

<p>He wanted to know about the beginning of things,
and what certain days meant, and who started customs,
and ever and ever so many things that you’d never suppose
a small boy would be interested in.</p>

<p>So, I’ve been wondering if there are not many boys
like Billy who, also, like to know about things that are
<em>really so</em>.</p>

<p>And so, I’ve written down a good many of the
things Somebody and the boy named Billy talked about
after the lights were out and the fireflies came, during
that wonderful summer in the north woods.</p>

<p id="p09_cap"><span class="hidden">T</span>HE boy named Billy
had begged to be allowed to stay up to greet the New Year. He had
something he wanted to ask him if he could only see him, but he
presently got so sleepy that his eyes wouldn’t stay open and so
off he went to bed and to sleep.</p>

<p>But all at once there was a great tooting of
whistles and ringing of bells, and a skyrocket
went “<em>whiz</em>” right past his window. The boy
named Billy sat up straight in bed.</p>

<p>“Oh,” said he, rubbing his eyes, “the New Year has come
and I didn’t even see him.”</p>

<p>“Happy New Year, Billy,” said a jolly little voice. The
boy named Billy rubbed his eyes to make sure—yes—he <em>really
did believe</em> that there was a roly-poly little person sitting on
the edge of the clock shelf swinging his bare pink feet and
smiling happily.</p>

<p>“Why,” gasped Billy, “who are you?”</p>

<p>“Whom did you expect?” asked the little fellow. “I’m
Father Time’s youngest year, to be sure. Haven’t got my
license, or my number yet; I’m waiting until this racket stops.
Were you looking for me for any special reason?”</p>

<p>“What I want to know,” said the boy named Billy, “is,
how does the world know where one year ends and a new
one begins?”</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>

<p>“That’s some question, youngster,” said the jolly New
Year, laughing merrily, “and it took the funny old world
some time to settle it. You see the year cannot be divided
evenly into months and days, because the time actually
required for the earth’s journey around the sun is 365 days,
5 hours, 48 minutes and 46 seconds. You call that the solar
year, because the word ‘solar’ means concerning the sun.</p>

<p>“The old Romans tried having the New Year come on
March first, but they had no real system, and were always in
trouble. So Julius Caesar, the king, told the world that it
was most important to have a calendar that could be depended
upon to take care of all the time, because there wasn’t any
too much, anyhow. So with the help of some very wise men
he took the twelve new moons of the year and built a calendar
around them. This was called the Julian calendar, and every
fourth year figured this way was made a ‘leap year,’ and was
given an extra day, making it 366 days long.</p>

<p>“But putting in a whole day every four years was too
much, and after this calendar had been used over 1,500 years
it was found that the calendar year was about ten days behind
the solar year which wouldn’t do at all.</p>

<p>“So Pope Gregory <abbr title="the thirteenth">XIII</abbr> directed that ten days be
dropped from the calendar that year and that the day after
October 4, 1582, should be October 15. Then he rearranged
the calendar so the New Year would begin January 1 and
the calendar year and the solar year kept together. The
Gregorian or New Style calendar as this one was called is the
one we are using today.</p>

<p>“New Year’s Day has been celebrated in various ways
since the dawn of civilization, and if today we could travel
around the world on a magic carpet what a wonderfully interesting
sight we would see!</p>

<p>“If you were in China you might think the Chinese saved
their holidays to celebrate all at once. They close their shops
for several days while they make merry with feasts and fireworks
and general exchange of gifts and good wishes. In
preparation every debt must have been paid, every house
swept and cleaned, and each person furnished with holiday
clothes and a supply of preserved fruits, candies, and ornamental
packages of tea to give to his acquaintances.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>

<p>“In some European nations, especially France and Scotland,
New Year’s Day is a more important <a id="chrstmas"></a>holiday than Christmas.
If you were a French peasant child you might put a
wooden shoe on the hearth for a gift at Christmas, but grownups
in France exchange gifts at the New Year festival, at which
time there are family parties, with much merrymaking.</p>

<p>“In America the observance of New Year’s Day is varied.
New Year’s Eve there are ‘watch night’ services in the
churches—gay street revelers—dancing and theater parties;
and New Year’s Day is a time for general entertaining and
visiting. However, the old custom of keeping open house
and making New Year’s calls has practically disappeared.</p>

<p>“People are always glad to see the New Year and always
welcome us in some glad and cheery way,” went on the New
Year. “And it has always been the custom among all people
to exchange gifts and greetings in the name of Happiness on
New Year’s day. The Old Year is supposed to take away
all sorrow and sadness, and the little New Year is supposed
to bring nothing but happiness into the world, so it depends
upon each person to see that he gets his share of the happiness.”</p>

<p>“How?” asked the boy named Billy.</p>

<p>“Easily,” answered the little New Year. “By living
straight, playing fair, being kind and honest and helping those
not so fortunate as you are. That’s all there is to it, little
friend. And there goes the last whistle and now for three
hundred and sixty-five days of real living. Happy New Year,
Billy.”</p>

<p>“Now I wonder,” murmured Billy sleepily, “if that was
<em>really so</em>, or did I dream it. I’m going to read up on that
calendar thing the very first thing I do, and I’m going to play
I saw the New Year anyway; and I’m going to try to do just
as I think he would want me to ’cause I want my share in
making this year a very, very happy one.”</p>

<p id="p12_cap"><span class="hidden">“M</span>OTHER has just had a telegram from
Grandmother that she’s on her way to visit us,” said the boy
named Billy. “I’m strong for Grandmother and I’m going to train
to meet her.”</p>

<p>“We’re all <em>fond</em> of Grandmother,”
corrected Big Sister, “and we’re all going
to the train to meet her. Who brought
the telegram?”</p>

<p>“Nobody brought it,” said the boy
named Billy. “When it got to town it
just hopped off the telegraph wires and
hopped on the telephone wire and came
right out here. That’s got magic beaten
a mile I’ll say. Whoever invented the telegraph system anyhow?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you with your ‘who inventeds’!” said Big Sister.
“Why don’t you study up such things yourself?”</p>

<p>“I can read it afterwards,” said the boy named Billy,
“but when Somebody tells it to me that makes a story of it.
Please, who did invent the Telegraph?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span></p>

<p>“Samuel F. B. Morse did,” said Somebody. “He was born
at Charlestown, Massachusetts, April 27th, 1791, and lived
until April 2nd, 1872. He was a portrait painter, and student
of chemistry, and went to London to study painting under
Benjamin West, where he made such progress that when he
returned to America he was given a commission to paint a
full length portrait of LaFayette.”</p>

<p>“LaFayette was some hero and worth painting,” said the
boy named Billy, “but when do we come to the telegraph?”</p>

<p>“Right now,” smiled Somebody. “The idea of electricity
had been talked of for a long time, and while Mr. Morse was
away on one of his trips to England it was found by some
experimenting that electricity could be conveyed by means of
wire over distances.</p>

<p>“A gentleman whom Mr. Morse met on ship board told
him of these experiments and it brought to his mind the old
belief held by Benjamin Franklin that intelligence some time
would be conveyed by electricity, a belief which he had always
shared. He went to work to perfect an instrument and a code
for the system which he had in mind, with the result that
when the boat landed his idea was ready to present.”</p>

<p>“He struck before the iron was hot, didn’t he?”</p>

<p>“In a manner of speaking, yes,” said Somebody, “but
it was two long years after that before the system was completed
and in working order. And it took quite some persuasion
also to get other people to believe in it, but finally
Congress voted him thirty thousand dollars to help him along
with his project and so he won out.</p>

<p>“Where, before, it had taken months and years to get
word from or to distant places, it could now be done almost
instantly. Samuel Morse’s life was one long record of courage,
integrity, patience and faith.”</p>

<p>“Bob White and I are fixing up a wireless on the roof
of our garage,” said the boy named Billy. “It’s two hours
before Grandmother’s train pulls in. Don’t forget to call
me, and many thanks, Somebody!”</p>

<p id="p14_cap" ><span class="hidden">“I</span> CAN’T seem to get
the real snap into the salute that Sergeant Jim does,” said the
boy named Billy. “He drills me on it every time I see him. But
try as I may I can’t seem to get the style into it, and I’ve just
got to learn it before I go into Scout camp; want to spring it on
the fellows.”</p>

<p>“Sergeant Jim didn’t learn it in a lesson or two, either,”
said Somebody. “He had it literally drilled into him. So
don’t get discouraged, Billy.”</p>

<p>“I’m not discouraged; I’m going to get it,” said the boy
named Billy. “Sergeant Jim says that when he first went into
the service he just hated the salute. But after a while when
he began to know what it meant, he didn’t mind it. What does
it mean? Why should a soldier salute an officer? An officer’s
no better than a soldier, is he?”</p>

<p>“Depends on how you look at it,” said Somebody quietly.
“The officer occupies a higher position and the salute is a
matter of courtesy—like saying ‘Good morning,’ to your
mother, or the boy next door.”</p>

<p>“It is also a matter of discipline, isn’t it?” asked Big Sister.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>

<p>“It has grown to be that, of course,” answered Somebody.
“But it first came into being because the soldiers who were
called the ‘Free Men of Europe’ were allowed to carry arms,
while the slaves or serfs and poorer classes were not. When one
military man met another it was customary for him to raise
his arm to show that he had no weapon in it, and that the
meeting was friendly. The slaves and serfs, not being allowed
to carry weapons, passed without salute. But so imitative are
we all that it was not long before everybody was saluting
everybody else, which did not suit the aristocratic army men,
who then resolved to make their salute so hard to learn that
it could not be imitated without real military service, so that
an outsider using it would brand himself as a commoner by his
incorrect manner of saluting.”</p>

<p>“And so that’s how it became,” said the boy named Billy.
“Well, I may not be a soldier, but I am going to <em>get it</em> if
Sergeant Jim’s patience holds out.”</p>

<p>“You may not be a soldier, but you are a soldier’s grandson,”
said Somebody. “And all of your people have been
soldiers when there was any need to fight for the Stars and
Stripes.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be right there when the Grand Old Flag needs me,”
said the boy named Billy. “And when I’m needed, I’m going
to be a captain, so I’ve just got to get this salute right.”</p>

<p>“You’ll have to watch your step in more ways than one,”
said Big Sister; “to be an officer in Uncle Sam’s Army means
that you must be very well educated, a real gentleman, able
to train your men, keep discipline, and make yourself popular
with them.</p>

<p>“You should see them drill at West Point, Billy. They
know, these fine, clean young men, that some day they will
be officers in Uncle Sam’s army so they are earnest—quick
to learn and accept the teaching of experienced instructors.
Strict mental and physical discipline is necessary to make
first rate officers.”</p>

<p>“Leave it to me,” said the boy named Billy, drawing himself
up and putting real snap into the salute. “I’m going to
be what Sergeant Jim calls a ‘regular.’”</p>

Grandfather says that we’re going to have six weeks more good
hard winter,” said the boy named Billy on one bright Candlemas
day, “because it’s been so sunshiny all day that the old
ground-hog couldn’t help seeing his shadow when he came out.”</p>

<p>“Well, I certainly hope he proves to be a false prophet
this time,” said Big Sister. “I’ve had all the winter I want
right now.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Sis, what do you mean you’ve had enough winter!”
exclaimed the boy named Billy, reproachfully, “winter’s the
jolliest time there is—with all the coasting and the tobogganning
and skating. I’m hoping it will stay cold so we can have
another carnival. Wasn’t the last one a peach! Bob White’s
father said he had never seen better fancy skating or more
exciting races. He told us to be a fancy skater you have to
have good balance, a sense of rhythm, and no little athletic
ability. I’m going to practice so I can do stunts at the carnival
next year. Say, Somebody, is there anything to that ground-hog
story?”</p>

<p>“Probably not,” said Somebody, “Mr. and Mrs. Arctomis
Monax, more familiarly known as Brother and Sister Woodchuck,
are pretty wise little people, and are more than likely
sleeping the sleep of the just at this time; yet I have heard of
them being lured from their dens by unusually bright weather
long before the vegetation upon which they feed had started
and that they paid for their foolishness with their lives, which
is too bad, because they are really nice little folk.”</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>

<p>“Why do they hibernate?” asked the boy named Billy.</p>

<p>“They belong to the family who do such things,” said
Somebody. “They, and the bears, and some other animals,
find it more convenient to store up fats in their little round
bodies in the summer time, and to curl up and sleep through
the winter months, when there is nothing to eat that they
really like. Saves a lot of trouble.”</p>

<p>“Where did that old yarn come from about them coming
out on this day?” asked the boy named Billy.</p>

<p>“The myth is very likely of Indian origin,” said Somebody,
“but there is also an old Scottish rhyme to the effect
that ‘if Candlemas day be fine and clear there’ll be twa
winters in the year.’”</p>

<p>“Do you know why the 2nd of February is called Candlemas
day?” asked the boy named Billy.</p>

<p>“It is another of those old made over Pagan Festivals,”
said Somebody. “The early Romans always used to burn
candles on that day to the goddess Februa, who was the
Mother of Mars, making a very beautiful and impressive
occasion of it.</p>

<p>“Pope Sergius, after the way of those old priests, wished
to do away with all the old pagan rites but did not dare to
openly raise the question, so he gave orders for candles to
be burned on that day to the Mother of Christ hoping that
in the new festival the old one would be lost sight of, which
proved to be true. The occasion is still celebrated in some
churches, and consecrated candles are supposed to be burned
for protection from all evil influences for the balance of the
year.”</p>

<p>“But there are so many of those old saints days that are
so entirely forgotten,” said Big Sister, “I wonder why Candlemas
is so universally remembered?”</p>

<p>“I think our friends, the Woodchucks, are responsible
for that,” said Somebody, with a smile.</p>

birthday tomorrow, and we do not
have school,” said the boy named Billy. “But I’ve
got to tell the class this afternoon why I think
Lincoln was the greatest American.”</p>

<p>“Suppose you tell us what you do know about
him,” suggested Somebody.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the boy named Billy, “I know he was born
in Hardin County, Kentucky, in a poor little old log cabin,
on February 12th, 1809. That he lived there until he was
seven years old, when he went with his family to Indiana,
where they were even poorer than before.</p>

<p>“His mother was never very strong, poor lady, and the
rough way in which they had to live was very hard for her,
and she died when Abraham was only nine years old. But
she taught him to be good, honest and true, and ‘learn all
he could and be of some account in the world.’</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>

<p>“After while, his father brought him another mother
who was very good to him and as he said later, ‘Moved heaven
and earth to give him an education.’ His school years were
few, but he was determined to know things, so he studied
every minute and often walked ten miles to borrow a book.
When he was twenty-one he owned six books, the Bible,
Pilgrim’s Progress, the Arabian Nights, Statutes of Indiana,
<a id="weems"></a>Weems’ ‘Life of Washington,’ and <a id="aesops"></a>‘Aesop’s Fables.’ He used
to read after his work was done by the light of the fire on
the family hearth. He almost memorized the Bible.</p>

<p>“He was very kindhearted and once when he went to New
Orleans with a flat boat full of lumber to sell, he saw some
slaves being sold. It affected him so strongly that he said
if he ever got a chance he was going to ‘hit that thing hard!’
He was never idle, and he was absolutely honest, and to be
depended upon.</p>

<p>“When he was 21 he went with his parents to a wilderness
farm in Illinois, which state almost lost him, because
if there had not been a flood making travel impossible he,
with his family, would have gone on to Wisconsin where they
had started for.</p>

<p>“After studying law, and practicing it for a good many
years, and being sent to Congress he was elected to be the
president of the United States in 1860, being the 16th president
of the land. He was in the presidential chair all through
the civil war and when he was shot, soon after his second
election, the whole country mourned for the man who had
‘<em>hit that thing hard</em>’ and abolished slavery.”</p>

<p>“Do you know his most famous address?” asked Sister.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>

<p>“Lincoln’s Gettysburg speech!” exclaimed Billy. “Well,
I should say—‘Fourscore and seven years ago our fathers
brought forth upon this continent a new nation, conceived in
liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are
created equal. Now we are engaged in the great Civil War,
testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived and
dedicated can long endure. We are met on a great battlefield
of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field
as a final resting-place for those who here gave their lives that
that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that
we should do this. But in a larger sense we cannot dedicate,
we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The
brave men, living and dead, who struggled here have consecrated
it far above our power to add or detract. The world
will little know nor long remember what we say here, but it can
never forget what they did here. It is for us, the living, rather
to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who
fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for
us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us,
that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to
that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion;
that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have
died in vain; that this nation, under God, shall have a new
birth of freedom, and that government of the people, by the
people, and for the people shall not perish from the earth.’”</p>

<p>“You seem to know a good many things about Lincoln
after all,” said Somebody, smiling proudly.</p>

<p>“Yes, but I do not know why he was the ‘<em>greatest</em> American’,”
said Billy.</p>

<p>“He was the ‘greatest American’,” said Somebody, “because
he loved the Union and determined that it must at all
costs be preserved. Because he knew that ‘united we should
stand, but that divided we must fall.’ Because his own life
counted for nothing where the Union was concerned. Because
it is due to him and to him only that we are not broken
up into small independent states, but are gathered together
under the best flag that the sun ever shone upon. Never has
the world seen a greater example of wisdom, patience, patriotism
and moral courage than animated his every act. Abraham
Lincoln is our greatest American because he stood for
honesty, loyalty, affection, willing service, and striving after
every kind of good.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got it now,” said the boy named Billy.</p>

<p>“It was the custom in ancient Rome to celebrate the
feasts of Lupercalia through the month of February in honor
of Pan and Juno and these feasts were very gay, indeed.
There was a custom of the young Pagans by means of which
they chose their dancing partners for the day, of writing the
name of a young man and a young woman and having a
drawing. The young man keeping the young lady whose
name he had drawn, as his partner for the day.</p>

<p>“The Christian Pastors of the churches objected to this
fun making and so they put the names of Priests in the boxes
to be drawn in place of the young women, and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Valentine’s
name came out as the guardian or saint of the day.</p>

<p>“He was accepted as such, but the young people went
on celebrating the day in the way to which they were accustomed
and out of that grew the idea of Valentine’s day.”</p>

<p>“That was a jolly way for it to start, wasn’t it?” exclaimed
the boy named Billy.</p>

<p>“When did people begin sending Valentine messages to
each other?” asked Big Sister.</p>

<p>“In early times in England and very likely also in other
parts of the world,” said Somebody, “it was the custom to
send a gift to the one who had been chosen as a young man’s
Valentine. This custom grew more popular year by year,
until, as the gifts must be worth while, it very likely grew
burdensome, and the sending of gifts was in a manner discontinued.
Then some bright person hit upon the plan of
sending dainty creations made of lace paper with bright and witty
verses written on them. Even that custom was about worn
out when some one in England sent a lacy affair to Miss
Esther Howland of Worcester, Massachusetts, who saw in it
a way to make some money; so she started making Valentines
for sale, and succeeded so well that the making of them
and the sale of them has grown to be a very great and important
industry.”</p>

<p>“So poor old <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Valentine just had the day <em>wished</em> on
him,” said the boy named Billy. “What ever did become
of him?”</p>

<p>“He offended someone,” said Somebody, “and was
beheaded.”</p>

<p>“Playful, weren’t they?” said the boy named Billy, as
he gathered up the Valentines.</p>

<p id="p24_cap"><span class="hidden">T</span>HE BOY named
Billy came into the room to say
goodbye to Somebody before going to the
celebration of George Washington’s birthday
at the schoolhouse.</p>

<p>“Your face has some black streaks on it,
Billy,” said Somebody. “Better go and remove
them and come back and tell me about it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t like to talk about it,” said the
boy named Billy, as he came back from the
wash room. “Mom scolded me.”</p>

<p>“What was it all about?” asked Somebody.</p>

<p>“I left my cap on the living room table
again. Mom found it there and she held it up for me to see
and said, ‘William!’”</p>

<p>Somebody tried not to smile. “That was severe! But
George Washington was often reproved by his mother.”</p>

<p>“George Washington,” said the boy named Billy, in
astonishment. “Did anyone ever scold <em>George Washington?</em>”</p>

<p>“Indeed, yes,” said Somebody, “and in a very unique
way, too. Mary Ball Washington was a wonderful woman,
with quantities of good sense and a remarkable idea of truth
and justice. It is said of her that when her children disobeyed,
or were in need of being reprimanded that she did
not trust herself to do it in her own language, but that she
always used the words of the Bible.”</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>

<p>“That was a queer way to scold,” said Billy.</p>

<p>“It worked judging from what we know of George and
his boyhood,” remarked Somebody. “When he was fourteen
he wished to go to sea, but as his mother thought it best that
he should not, he abandoned the idea and was given two additional
years of schooling, chiefly in mathematics, and so prepared
himself for the profession of a surveyor.”</p>

<p>“Sixteen, and finishing school!” exclaimed the boy named
Billy.</p>

<p>“School was rather a different affair in George Washington’s
day,” said Somebody. “He was born in the country,
at a small place named Bridges Creek, Virginia, on the
twenty second of February, 1732, and at that time the country
was very small and had few schools.”</p>

<p>“It must have been fun being a surveyor,” said Billy.</p>

<p>“It was not much <em>fun</em>, Billy Boy,” Somebody told him.
“It was a severe test of character and capacity, but George
Washington always accomplished every task given him with
success, and reported on it with brevity and modesty.</p>

<p>“The traits of steadfastness of character which he had
displayed in school and among his playmates now came out
prominently. He excelled in running, wrestling, and horseback
riding in his youth and in later years, because of his
wisdom, patience, tolerance, courage and consecration to the
righteous cause of liberty became the father of his country.”</p>

<p>“My but his mother must have been proud of him,”
said Billy.</p>

<p>Somebody nodded. “It was to his mother, a woman of
strong and devoted character, that George Washington owed
his moral and religious training. Even when her son had
risen to the height of human greatness, she would only say,
‘George has been a good boy, and I’m sure he will do his
duty.’”</p>

<p>“Guess I better tell Mom I’m sorry about leaving my
hat on the living room table,” said the boy named Billy.</p>

<p>“I would if I were you,” said Somebody.</p>

<p id="p26_cap"><span class="hidden">“G</span>ET MY new
Scout suit,” said the boy named Billy,
coming in with himself all in khaki. “Look at
the buttons, ’n the leggins ’n all!”</p>

<p>“It’s very Scouty looking,” said Big Sister.
“I hope you’ll keep it that way.”</p>

<p>“Have to,” said the boy named Billy, “or
get a demerit. Going for drill now over on the parade ground
in front of the armory. Got just long enough for Somebody
to tell me when and where the Boy Scout movement started.”</p>

<p>“The Boy Scout movement,” said Somebody, “started
in England in 1908 being launched by Sir Robert S. S. Baden
Powell.”</p>

<p>“Oh say!” exclaimed the boy named Billy, “why did
we have to let England beat us to it?”</p>

<p>“We didn’t—exactly,” said Somebody, smiling at the
zeal of the young patriot, “because at that very time we had
two organizations which had the same purpose in view. One
was called the Wood-Craft Indians founded by Ernest Seton
Thompson, and another called the Sons of Daniel Boone
founded by Dan Beard. Both men were popular writers of
out of door stories, and greatly interested in boys and their
sports and activities.</p>

<p>“Scouting gives a boy something to do, something he
likes to do, something worth doing. It has succeeded in doing
what no other plan of education has done—made the boy want
to learn. It organizes the gang spirit into group loyalty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span></p>

<p>“In 1910 both these organizations were combined under
the title of the Boy Scouts of America, and as you of course
know, Billy Boy, before a boy can become a Scout he must
take the Scout oath of office.”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” said the boy named Billy. “Wait, ’til I
see if I’m up on that. ‘On my honor I will do my best—To
do my duty to God and my country, and to obey the scout
law; to help other people at all times; to keep myself physically
strong, mentally awake, and morally straight.’</p>

<p>“A scout is required to know the Scout oath and law and
subscribe to both. But his obligation does not end here. He
is expected not only not to forget his oath and law, but to live
up to them in letter and spirit from first to last.”</p>

<p>“Fine!” said Somebody. “That sounds like a perfectly
good working rule. Now what are some of your ideals as
Scouts?”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Billy, “we’re divided into three classes.
Tenderfoot, that’s what Bob White and I are as yet, but
we’ll grow—second class Scouts and first class. According to
Scout law one must have honor, loyalty, unselfishness, friendliness,
hatred of snobbishness, must be courteous, be really
kind to animals, and always obedient to fathers and mothers
’n Somebodys, be gentle, fair minded, save money, look out
for fires and clean up after oneself.”</p>

<p>“On account of that last item, thanks be that you joined
the Scouts, Billy,” said Big Sister, “and just to help you
along, suppose you run up and wash the bowl where you just
washed your hands.”</p>

<p>“Oh, excuse me, Sis!” said the boy named Billy, “I guess
I forgot, but I won’t after this.</p>

<p>“I’m going to have a lesson on first aid this morning,
so if you ever get a sprained ankle or anything I can hold
the lines until the doctor gets here. S’long.”</p>

<p>“All of which means that I scrub up after the youngster
myself,” said Big Sister, “but Billy’s a pretty good scout at
that.”</p>

march in the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Patrick’s day parade,” said the boy named Billy,
“and that leaves me without a thing to do, unless Somebody will
tell me <em>who</em> <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Patrick was and why all Irish people think
so much of him.”</p>

<p>“Strange as it may seem,” said Somebody,
“<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Patrick was not an Irishman at all, but was
by birth a Scotchman, having been born in Scotland about
372. When he was sixteen or seventeen years old he was
stolen by Pirates and taken to Ireland and made to work at
herding swine. He was a very studious boy and in the seven
years that he remained a swineherd he learned the Irish
language and the customs of the people.</p>

<p>“He then made up his mind that swineherding was not
the right sort of occupation for a bright-minded youth like
himself, so he escaped to the Continent, where after more
years of study he was ordained by Pope Celestine and sent
back to Ireland to preach Christianity to the people.</p>

<p>“But the old priests did not like him. He was very likely
too bright for them, and they persecuted him, and made
things very uncomfortable for him. Finally he was obliged to
leave there, but before he went he cursed the lands of the other
priests so that they would not bear crops, just to even up
things.</p>

  <div class="hidden">But just then an Angel came</div>
</div>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>

<p>“He was none too comfortable himself, but he did not
mind small discomforts because one cold and snowy morning
when they were on the top of a mountain with no fire to cook
their breakfast <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Patrick told his followers to gather a great
pile of snowballs, and when that had been done he breathed
upon them and immediately there was a great glowing fire,
and they got breakfast very nicely. This and other miracles
made him very popular, and so when the scourge of snakes
came he was sent for and begged to disperse the reptiles.</p>

<p>“‘Easy,’ said <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Patrick, ‘bring me a drum.’ When the
drum came he began beating it with such vim and vigor that
he broke its head, and it looked for a time as though the trick
would fail. But just then an angel came and mended the drum
and the snakes were forever banished. Just to prove it they
kept the drum for many centuries.</p>

<p>“These and other marvels were performed by <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Patrick,
who lived to be 121 years old, dying on his birthday, March
17th, 492.</p>

<p>“Historians have relegated many stories about Saint
Patrick to the realm of myth, but the shamrock remains the
emblem of Ireland, proudly worn by Irishmen the world over
on Saint Patrick’s Day, March seventeenth. The true shamrock
(in Irish seamrog, meaning “three-leaved”) is the hop
clover, which much resembles our common white clover,
except that the flower is yellow instead of blue-green. Large
shipments of shamrocks are brought to the United States for
Saint Patrick’s Day.”</p>

<p>“So the shamrock is the National emblem of Irish people,”
said Billy.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Somebody. “And it is said that no snake can
live where it grows.</p>

<p>“Perhaps if one will take the trouble to think it out, one
may find in that belief the idea of faith and loyalty and love of
country for which the Irish people are noted, and that emblematically
it means that no traitor to Ireland can live near
the Shamrock.”</p>

<p>“I see,” said the boy named Billy, “they feel as we do
about our Eagle, don’t they?”</p>

<p>“Ash-Wednesday,” said Somebody, “is the beginning of
Lent, which lasts forty days and ends with the Saturday
before Easter Sunday. It is supposed to commemorate the
forty days fasting Christ did before His Crucifixion.”</p>

<p>“My,” said the boy named Billy, “I never could fast
forty hours let alone forty days! How is it supposed to help
a person to go without food for so long?”</p>

<p>“Fasting,” said Somebody, “is to teach the lesson of self
restraint, and self control, and to help us endure discomforts
without complaining, how to refrain from all unkind thoughts
of others, to control our tempers and make us better people
generally.</p>

<p>“It’s a very good idea for each one of us to give up something
during Lent; something that we like very much indeed,
and to give the money that it would have cost to some one
who really needs food and comforts.”</p>

<p id="p32_cap"><span class="hidden">“T</span>OMORROW is Palm Sunday,” said the boy
named Billy. “Why do some churches give the
people palm branches to carry?”</p>

<p>“On the Sunday preceding the crucifixion
Christ made his triumphal entrance into Jerusalem. All the
people came out to meet him, strewing palm branches in his
path to do him honor, just as you school children all cheer
when the president, or some great hero comes to town.”</p>

<p>“Jerusalem is a warm country and must have many
beautiful flowers,” said the boy named Billy. “Why didn’t
they bring flowers instead of stiff, rusty palm branches?”</p>

<p>“Because they wished to show him <em>all</em> honor,” said
Somebody. “And the palm was their emblem of joy and
peace and victory. His goodness and power were beginning
to have their effect on the minds of the people. They were
beginning to believe that Jesus was really the Christ whom
their forefathers had promised would come and bring them
comfort, peace and general good tidings.”</p>

<p>The boy named Billy looked puzzled. “So they hailed
him on Palm Sunday and crucified him the following Friday!”</p>

<p>Somebody nodded. “Human praise and opinion is like that—it is
always a variable thing full of chance and change—unstable—but
Jesus wasn’t moved for a moment by the praise and flattery of the
people, because he knew what was in store for him in Jerusalem.
He knew that Judas Iscariot, one of his own disciples, would
betray him to the chief priests and magistrates who hated him,
because they were afraid he would convert the people and uncover
their own wickedness. Christ Jesus knew that he must suffer
violence at the hands of those who hated goodness so that he
might prove beyond shadow of doubt, by his resurrection, that
love is greater than hate—that love is always victorious,
because God is Love.”</p>

<p>“I think this is the best really-so story of all!” said Billy.</p>

“want to go to the movies?”</p>

<p>“Can’t, thank you, Sis,” called back the
boy named Billy. “Got to study my Sunday
School lesson.”</p>

<p>After a half hour of deep study the boy
named Billy put the book on the table and said,
“That’s great stuff, that story of David and
Goliath. Who wrote the Bible, please? It <em>was</em>
written by someone, was it not?”</p>

<p>“There were many sacred books written by many different
men at many different periods of the world’s history,”
said Somebody, “which were accepted as the inspired Word
of God.</p>

<p>“At first these were put out as separate volumes, but
after a long time they were gathered together and bound
into one volume.</p>

<p>“The books of the Old Testament were originally written
in Hebrew and those of the New Testament in Greek. Think
of the labor of love it must have been to make copies of the
Bible. In those days it all had to be done by hand as printing
was not invented until a thousand years after the new Testament
was written.”</p>

<p>“Some undertaking,” said the boy named Billy. “Were
all other books made the same way?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” said Somebody, “a book was a priceless
possession in those days, and there’s not much wonder that
there were very few scholars—only priests and physicians
had the leisure to become learned, even if they could have
obtained the books from which to study.”</p>

<p>“The Bible we have is then a translation,” said the boy
named Billy.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>

<p>“The Bible was translated into various languages,” said
Somebody, “but the first English version was translated
from the Latin by a priest named John Wycliffe, of Lutterworth,
England. He believed that the Bible belonged to
everybody and should be put into such form that everyone
could read it. But instead of being thanked and made much
of for the very great service he was doing he was put out of
the church and called a heretic for daring to meddle with
the word of God—which did not stop his work at all, because
he finished it. After his death no one did any more about
it for a hundred years or so until Johan Guttenberg discovered
the art of printing, and when in 1454 the use of movable type
was found possible many copies of the Bible were printed
and everyone could have his own.</p>

<p>“In 1516 Erasmus, a learned Greek scholar, published
the New Testament, which was translated by William Tyndale,
who was so persecuted by those who did not want it
published that he was obliged to go to Germany to finish
his work; even there he was so hampered that it was not
until 1525 that the New Testament was finally printed.</p>

<p>“Merely as literature, it has made a deeper impression
upon the human mind than has any other book, and the extent
to which it has helped shape the world’s ideas cannot be
estimated. No matter how much you know of poetry or
prose, you cannot consider yourself well read unless you are
thoroughly acquainted with the Bible.”</p>

<p>“It is wonderful that the language has been kept so beautiful
after all those translations and copyings,” said the boy
named Billy.</p>

<p>“Very likely it was changed a good bit,” said Somebody,
“but its wonderful message of Truth has not been changed.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know where there’s another story like that of
David,” said Billy, “and the one about Joseph’s coat has
any one of the six best sellers beaten a mile.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you’ll like to know,” said Somebody, “that
the Bible, year in and year out is <em>THE</em> best seller.”</p>

<p>“I don’t wonder,” said the boy named Billy.</p>

<span class="hidden">“T</span>OMORROW will be Good Friday,” said the boy
named Billy. “That is the day on which Christ
Jesus was crucified, wasn’t it, Somebody?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Somebody, “and is why it is
remembered by us all in one way or another—by church
services, or in our thoughts.”</p>

<p>“Of course I know the story,” said the boy named Billy,
“but won’t you please tell it over again?”</p>

<p>“Early in the morning Christ Jesus prayed to God, his
Father, saying that his mission had been accomplished (you’ll
find this beautiful prayer in the seventeenth chapter of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
John’s gospel, Billy boy). Then he went into the Garden of
Gethsemane with his disciples. Judas Iscariot, the disciple
who betrayed Jesus, knew the place where he would be and
went there with a band of men and officers from the chief
priests and Pharisees. (The Pharisees were narrow minded
people who paid excessive regard to empty tradition and dead
ceremonies. They observed the form, but neglected the spirit
of religion.)</p>

<p>“Jesus was arrested, and brought before the Sanhedrin, the
Jewish council of priests and elders. After a hasty trial they
pronounced him guilty of death for blasphemy. They said ‘we have
a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself
the Son of God.’ <abbr title="Saint John, Chapter 19, verse
7">St. John 19:7</abbr>. And He <em>was</em> the Son of God, sent
by the loving Father to bring understanding to the people so they
might obey and love God and know the blessing of trusting Him
always.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>

<p>“Then the council of priests and elders delivered Jesus
to Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor. Pilate didn’t sympathize
with the wishes of the people. He said, “I find in him
no fault <em>at all</em>.” But the people insisted that he give him
up to be crucified, so he washed his hands to show them that
he took no responsibility in the affair whatsoever. And they
took Jesus away—put a crown of thorns on his head, and
followed him with taunts and abuse of every kind as he,
bearing his cross, led the way to Golgotha, the place of his
execution.</p>

<p>“There on that never to be forgotten Calvary, Christ
Jesus was crucified with a criminal on either side.</p>

<p>“Jesus’ body was taken from the cross and placed in a
tomb by Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus. Three days
later, on the first day of the week, when some of the women
came with spices to embalm the body, they found the tomb
empty. An angel who kept watch told them that Christ had
risen from the dead. The risen Christ appeared first to Mary
Magdalene, the once sinful woman from whom Jesus had cast
out seven devils, and who had become one of the most devoted
of his followers; and then to others who were close to him. He
spent forty days on earth after his resurrection, and then from
the midst of his disciples he was taken up to heaven. He left
no writings and no organized church. But from recollections
of his teachings his followers later put together the record of
his ministry, as we have it in the New Testament, and with it
there slowly took shape also the organized Christian church,
which more and more has ruled men’s lives.”</p>

<p>“I wish I had been there,” said the boy named Billy,
“I could have helped some way, I know.”</p>

<p>“You can help every day, Billy Boy,” said Somebody,
“by being kind to everybody, and doing unto others just
the thoughtful, loving things you want others to do unto you.”</p>

said Somebody. “You’ll find some on my wash stand.”</p>

<p>The boy named Billy scrubbed with right good will.
“It’s coming off,” he said. “Say, Somebody, please tell me
why Easter doesn’t stand still, like Christmas and New

likely as not in April the next? A day is a day, isn’t it?
Then why do we never know when to look for it? Last year
we gathered pussy willows, and this year it’s cold enough to
skate.”</p>

<p>“It is puzzling until you understand about it,” said Somebody,
as Billy came back with his hands as clean as could be expected.
“Let’s talk about it. There seems to be no authentic record of
the actual date of Christ’s death and burial and resurrection. We
know that the Crucifixion was on Friday, and the Resurrection was
on Sunday, but the date has never been accounted for, although
Easter has been celebrated as a church festival since the early
days of the Christian church.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>

<p>“To settle all such disputes it was finally decided by the
Council of Nicaea in 325 A. D. that the celebration of the
festival commemorating the Resurrection should fall on the
first Sunday after March 21st and the full moon.”</p>

<p>“And why was the festival called Easter?” asked the boy
named Billy.</p>

<p>“It is a sort of made-over festival,” said Somebody.
“The early Christians called it the Paschal festival, and it
was so called until the Christian religion was introduced
among the Saxons, who had a Spring festival themselves of
which they were very fond, held in honor of their Spring goddess
Eostre. They seemed inclined to like the new religion,
but refused to give up their goddess, so the Christians decided
to keep the festival and the name, but to use it in commemoration
of the resurrection of Christ.”</p>

<p>“Who was this lady named Eostre?” asked the boy named
Billy. “She must have been pretty important.”</p>

<p>“Eostre, meaning ‘from the East, or Venus, the goddess
of beauty,’ was supposed to have been hatched by doves
from an immense egg which descended from heaven and
rested on the Euphrates. Out of it came the goddess of
Spring and of beauty to bring warmth and sunshine into the
world,” said Somebody.</p>

<p>“That must be where the idea of the Easter egg comes
from,” said the boy named Billy. “I was wondering about
that. It’s interesting; tell me some more.”</p>

<p>“There are many beautiful legends concerning Easter,”
said Somebody. “One which was quite generally believed in
Ireland was that on Easter morning the sun dances. But of
course we take that with a grain of salt.”</p>

<p>“Just as we take our Easter eggs,” laughed the boy
named Billy. “Thank you so much, Somebody; and now
I’ll run and get some flowers for Mother. I’m going to get
her a beautiful Easter lily.”</p>

<span class="hidden">“S</span>EE what I’ve got for Mom,” said the boy
named Billy bursting into Somebody’s room
one bright morning in the latter part of
April. “May Flowers! Beauties! Found
them away over in the pine woods just
peeping out from under a snow bank.”</p>

<p>“Beauties indeed,” agreed Somebody,
“I’m glad you cut them so carefully. Most children do not
understand the importance of cutting wild flowers instead of
tearing them up by the roots.”</p>

<p>“I ought to understand it unless I’m a <em>dunce</em>,” laughed
Billy, “you and Mom tell me about it often enough. But
why is it called Mayflower when it always comes in April?
Of course I know its real name is Trailing Arbutus.”</p>

<p>“The Mayflower,” said Somebody, “is spring’s first messenger
wherever it will grow, and its appearance is governed
by the length of the winter, and not by the calendar. I’ve
heard of it in the Rocky Mountains in August. It seems not
to be able to live in very warm places, but loves to snuggle
its blossom children under the snows of winter, who, when
they awake push aside the blankets and creep out to tell the
world that spring has come.</p>

<p>“And small as it is,” went on Somebody, “the dear little
pink flower has made history for itself. It was the first flower
to welcome the Pilgrim Fathers and Mothers to the new world
and as spring, on the bleak coast of Massachusetts, is a late
comer, it probably appeared in May, and was christened Mayflower
by the pioneers who knew no other name for it. Anyway
it was very welcome to those poor people who had come
through so many hardships, with its glorious message that the
long and cruel winter was over.”</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>

<p>“Was the boat named after the flower or the other way
around?” asked the boy named Billy.</p>

<p>“I think it must have been that the flower was named
after the boat,” answered Somebody, “as the Mayflower was
the boat they came over in—a little sailing vessel of one
hundred and eighty tons. Yet no other ship’s arrival has
had such significance as that of this little vessel, which brought
the Pilgrim Fathers to America in 1620. The sailing of the
Mayflower meant a great deal to the future of mankind,
because the Pilgrim Fathers formed the compact that established
the government of the people, by the people, and for the
people. It is well known that they loved the little posie, the
first thing that welcomed them with a smile of hopefulness.”</p>

<p>“Why do we not try to cultivate it in our gardens?”</p>

<p>“It starves in gardens,” said Somebody, “very likely because
its needs are not studied. Science has found that it has
upon its roots a friendly fungus which nourishes it. And this
friend refuses to live in the soil of the ordinary garden. Experiments
have been made with soils, and seed from the Mayflower
fruit has been planted and has made some progress, so
I’ve heard.”</p>

<p>“I did not know that the flower <em>had</em> a fruit,” said the
boy named Billy.</p>

<p>“I have seen only a few,” said Somebody. “It is a small
fruit which tastes not unlike a strawberry. Mrs. Ant knows
all about it, and it is very likely due to her that you find the
flower in places where it never has been found before.”</p>

<p>“So,” said the boy named Billy, “when one tries to provide
a new home for Lady Trailing Arbutus, one must not
only please her very dainty tastes but those of her friends.”</p>

<p>“You’ll never get very far with flowers or friends, Billy
Boy,” said Somebody, “unless you study them very carefully
and try with all your heart to understand them.”</p>

<p>Billy grinned. “What time do you look for Mayflower
fruit?” said he.</p>

<p>“Along about wild strawberry time,” said Somebody.</p>

<span class="hidden">“M</span>Y,” said the boy named Billy. “I nearly
broke my tooth on the bone of this oyster.
Isn’t it funny? It’s as round as a shot and
just as hard.”</p>

<p>Everybody laughed, but Somebody said, “That isn’t a
bone, Billy; old Mr. Oyster has no bones. That’s a pearl. Too
bad you didn’t find it before it was cooked, because then you
might have had it set in a pin to wear in your scarf. Now that
it has been cooked, it is worthless.”</p>

<p>“I’m in luck, anyhow,” said Billy, “because I didn’t
break my tooth. But how did a pearl ever get inside an
oyster?”</p>

<p>“It makes its home there,” said Somebody. “Lives
snugly year after year inside Mr. Oyster’s shell and pays no
rent at all.”</p>

<p>“Tell me about it,” demanded the boy named Billy. “I
always supposed that pearls grew at the bottom of the sea.”</p>

<p>“So they do,” said Somebody, “about fifteen fathoms
deep is where the pearl bearing oyster lives. He is rather
particular about his home and selects a place where there is a
swift current of water. There he and his family lie on the
hard bed of the ocean and wait for the current to bring
their food. Sometimes they prefer to attach themselves to
an overhanging ledge, where they live closely huddled together.
The ancient peoples had all sorts of beliefs and ideas
about the origin of the pearl. One of the most poetical was
that it was made from a drop of dew which the oyster came up
to the top of the ocean to get. Another was that pearls were
the tears of angels who wept over the sorrows of the world.”</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>

<p>“But what are they really?” asked the boy named Billy,
his eyes big with interest.</p>

<p>“Science has discovered,” said Somebody, “that Mr.
Oyster accidentally gets a grain of sand, or a small insect
inside his shell, which becomes uncomfortable; but as the
oyster has no way of opening his door and putting an unwelcome
guest outside, it remains. Very likely the unwelcome
guest hurts. So Mr. Oyster says, ‘All right, then stay if you
want to. But you can’t go on hurting me if I know myself.’
And so he builds a wall of the stuff that the inside of his shell
is made of between himself and the cause of the trouble.
After about four years the oyster is likely to be caught by
pearl fishers, the pearl found, and the shell used for inlaid
work on boxes, knife handles and other things.</p>

<p>“The finest pearls are gathered in the East, the most
valuable, worth tens of thousands of dollars, coming from the
oysters of the Persian Gulf. The largest pearl fishery in
America is that of lower California, from which come the
largest and the finest black pearls on the market.</p>

<p>“Carl von Linné, the great Swedish naturalist and botanist,
discovered that pearls could be grown by opening the
shell of the oyster and slipping a small bead of lead or wax
inside the shell and then putting the oyster back in his bed
for three or four years. Acting upon that idea, the Chinese
and Japanese people have established great pearl raising
industries and turn out a large amount of pearls every year.
They are very pretty, and of good color, but being flat on one
side they cannot be made into necklaces. In several of our
states the fresh water clams are pearl bearers; the Mississippi
River industry being the one of most value. The shells are used
for pearl buttons and the flesh of the mussels are fed to the pigs.”</p>

<p>“Makes you think of that verse in the Bible about casting
your pearls before swine, doesn’t it?” laughed Billy.</p>

    <p class="verse0">‘Come little fish and play with me’;</p>
    <p class="verse0">Said little fishie in a fright,</p>
    <p class="verse0">‘I’ve heard about your appetite,’”</p>

<p class="p0">read the boy named Billy from little Sister’s Bird Children
book. “Wise little fishie wasn’t he youngster?” said he.
“Why is a Pelican anyway—he isn’t good to be eaten and his
feathers aren’t worth anything, and he doesn’t do anything
except to eat fish in great quantities, at least that is all I’ve
ever heard about.”</p>

<p>“Long ago,” said Somebody, “when the first expeditions
went across the Colorado desert which had been, until the
Colorado River cut it off, a part of the Gulf of California,
some one remarked that if the desert could be watered it
could be made to raise food enough for a nation. There was
the Colorado River going to waste, of course, but how to
harness it up and make it provide water for the desert which
it had made was a question which no one could answer.</p>

<p>“But along in 1904 it was decided to make the attempt
to turn a part of the river back into its old bed and make it
work. The river wasn’t quite ready to go back and when
she did she meant to go in her own sweet way—but if they
wanted her to back into that old bed, why back she would
go—and, taking things in her own mighty hands, back she
did go with a rush. There was that old Salton Sea Sink—she
would first fill that up, and from there it would be easy to
give the people all the water they wanted on the desert.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>

<p>“This was serious! There was a railroad in her track—but
what did that matter—people wanted water and water
she would give them. It was a Nation’s work to stop that
runaway river, but at last it was done, and lo and behold—there
was that lovely little sea shining like a jewel in the
middle of the desert. They eventually made the Colorado
give them water enough besides to water the desert which is
now called the Imperial Valley where rice and fruit and cotton
and many other things are raised.”</p>

<p>“That is interesting,” said the boy named Billy. “But
where does Mr. Pelican fit in?”</p>

<p>“Right here,” said Somebody. “For along about this
time very probably along came Mr. and Mrs. Brown Pelican
looking for a home. And here was a lovely sea with lots of
dear little islands in it just big enough for two. But after they
had started their nest they discovered that their private sea
had no fish in it. Very probably Brown Pelican said they
would move back to the coast, but that Mrs. Pelican wouldn’t
listen to him but said, ‘Here we have a whole ocean all to ourselves;
let’s raise our own fish—we’ll go right now and bring
back our pockets full of mullets and plant them.’ So they
did with the result that the Salton Sea is now one of the most
important fisheries in the state of California.”</p>

<p>“That’s <em>some</em> story,” said the boy named Billy. “But is
it a <em>Really So</em> one?”</p>

<p>“According to scientists it is,” said Somebody. “The
Pelican has long been known to be the best friend of the game
warden, which is why he is protected. He is supposed to
carry fish to inland streams and ponds which otherwise would
not have them.”</p>

<p>“Well, he should advertise,” said the boy named Billy,
“nobody knows how useful he is.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he is too modest,” said Somebody.</p>

Day,” said the

“and there isn’t going to be any school; we’re all
going out to see their games and get acquainted;
anybody seen my scout suit? It isn’t in my closet.”</p>

<p>“It has gone to the cleaner’s,” said Mother.
“I knew you’d want it tomorrow and so I sent it
out; it will be back this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, Mom,” said Billy, “you always do
think of everything. Why are the Indians called
Indian? Did they name themselves that the way
other people do?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Somebody. “That was the name
Columbus gave to the natives when he reached the
islands and mainland of our country under the
impression that he had arrived at the coast of
Asia, which he had set out to find.”</p>

<p>“How did those people ever come to be here?”</p>

<p>“It is supposed,” said Somebody, “that they had crossed
from Asia to Alaska, and were cut off in some way from returning
and so drifted inland and started colonies which prospered
until it spread across the whole continent. Some may have
come from China, and there is even a tradition that some were
from the lost tribes of Israel, but no one really knows. All we
know is that if they were not really natives of this land that
they must have come from somewhere and that they had
degenerated into savages or had never been lifted above it.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>

<p>“But take it all in all they were pretty good savages until
they were aroused by the whites; they had laws of their own,
and a religion, and real languages distinguishing the different
tribes; they had kings and principalities, and the Great Spirit
was very real to them. To the Indian everything in Nature
had a real personality and was inhabited by a spirit either
good or bad.</p>

<p>“They believed in monsters, and fairies and witches. The
women were the only ones who could declare war, and when
prisoners were brought in they had the right to adopt them
into the tribe, or if they did not like them to send them to
death.”</p>

<p>“Sweet and gentle ladies, weren’t they?” said the boy
named Billy. “I’m glad that they’re just folks nowadays.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad also,” said Somebody, “and this move to have
a day set aside for the purpose of getting better acquainted is
a move in the right direction.”</p>

<p>“I wonder who thought of doing that,” asked the boy
named Billy.</p>

<p><a id="ideaof"></a>“The idea of having a day set apart for the
celebration of the deeds of the red race belongs to Mr. A. C.
Parker, State Archaeologist of New York, who launched it at
the National Conference at Denver; but no date being set at
that time it was later taken up at the Lawrence Kansas conference,
when President Coolidge of the Society of American
Indians moved to have May 13th appointed as Indian Day,
which was done. The different states, in addition to this, have
nearly all set apart days of their own as Indian days. That of
Illinois being September 4th.”</p>

<p>“We folks in America do get around to doing our duty in
time, if you give us time enough,” said the boy named Billy.</p>

<p>“It was high time in this case,” said Somebody.</p>

<p>“Sure was,” said Billy. “I’m going to get acquainted
with some Indian about my own age and get some pointers
about how to use that bow and arrow Uncle Ned brought me
from out west!”</p>

<span class="hidden">“I</span>N THAT direction,” the cat said, waving
his right paw, “lives the hatter.
And in that direction,” waving the
other paw around, “lives a March hare.
Visit either you like—they’re both mad!”</p>

<p>The boy named Billy was reading aloud
from Alice in Wonderland, and when he had finished this
sentence he looked up, keeping his place with his finger shut in
the book, and said, “I know what a March hare would be; it
would mean any old hare in the month of March, very likely,
but what’s a hatter? Is it a real animal, or a madeup creature,
like the Unicorn or the Dodo Bird, or is it just a man who sells
hats, as a grocer does groceries?”</p>

<p>“You’ve come very close to the real meaning of it,” said
Somebody, “for a hatter, as I see it, is one who makes hats.”</p>

<p>“Why, of course,” said the boy named Billy, “if I’d taken
time to think a little about it I’d have known. When did
people begin to wear hats, anyway, and what made them do
it? They’re a great bother—always blowing off when one is
out-of-doors and having to be hung up when one is indoors—they’re
no good except to keep one’s head warm and hair
would do that if we gave it a chance.”</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>

<p>“Up to a certain point, Billy,” laughed Somebody, “if hair
would only stay on as well as hats do even, I’m sure everybody
would agree with you, but hair does not stay put in a good many
cases, and hats are far better and much less trouble than it
would be to wear wigs. No, I think the hat is a very useful
invention.</p>

<p>“In fact, it is said that the earliest form of hat was a sort
of hood which was tied on over the head to keep the hair from
blowing ‘every which way,’ as it was common for both men and
women to wear the hair long and to allow it to hang loosely.”</p>

<p>“When did the kind of hats that we wear begin to be
stylish?”</p>

<p>“About the time men began to cut their hair short, I
suppose,” said Somebody. “The chimney-pot hat, from
which all the other shapes grew, is only a little more than a
hundred years old.”</p>

<p>“What are hats made of?” asked Billy. “I don’t mean
ladies’ hats, of course, they are made of everything, but the
kind we men wear.”</p>

<p>Somebody smiled. “The kind you men wear are made
of various things. The very fine ones are made from Beaver
fur and Coney fur, and Molly Cotton Tail furnishes material
for a great many with her long hair which is chopped very
fine, and some are made entirely of wool. The braid for the
straw hats comes almost entirely from Italy, China and Japan,
but is sewed and blocked in this country.”</p>

<p>“Do we make many hats here?” asked Billy.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” said Somebody, “making hats was one of
our earliest and most profitable industries. In 1675 laws
were passed prohibiting the sale of Raccoon fur outside the
provinces, because they were so valuable to the hatters, and
it has grown into one of our greatest industries.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the boy named Billy, “I know now what a
hatter is, but I still do not know what he was mad <em>about</em>?”</p>

<p>“That was just a figure of speech,” said Somebody,
“meaning that he was not quite right in his head!”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said the boy named Billy, going on with the story.</p>

“That was his big and splendid way of telling everybody just

the things she had done for him.”</p>

<p>“Being his mother was enough,” said the boy named
Billy, “what more did she do for him?”</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>

<p>“His father died when he was just three years old,”
said Somebody, “leaving his mother nothing in the world
except a stony farm in the wilderness. She had to work the
farm with the help of her eldest son, who was fourteen years
old, and also do all the work of the house. Indeed, there was
one summer when she lived on one scanty meal a day so that
the children might have enough. This made a great impression
on James, who resolved that when he grew up he would
take great care of her.</p>

<p>“Washington said he owed his success in life to his
mother, who gave him his strict sense of honesty and fairness.</p>

<p>“Napoleon said of his mother, ‘She watched over us with
devotion, and allowed nothing but what was good and elevating
to take root in our understanding.’</p>

<p>“Abraham Lincoln’s mother died when Abraham was ten
years old, but she had taught him all she knew of reading,
writing, and arithmetic, and also to take pains with everything
he did, and to love God and fear no man.</p>

<p>“Although Lincoln never forgot his own dear mother, it
was to his father’s second wife that he often said he owed his
success, as she almost moved heaven and earth to give him
an education.”</p>

<p>“Have we always had Mother’s Day?” asked Billy.</p>

<p>“No, indeed,” said Somebody. “It’s quite recent. Miss
Anna Jarvis of Philadelphia, who lost her own dear mother
in 1906, presented the world with the idea of setting aside a
day for the honoring and remembering of all mothers. The
world was ready for the idea, and gladly took it up, and so
we have this beautiful custom, which is yearly growing
stronger, of remembering our mothers in some special way,
sending a flower or a greeting, and wearing a white carnation
to show our love and devotion to our own particular
mother.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the boy named Billy, “Mom’s the best
thing in the world any way.”</p>

<p>“Then say so,” said Somebody, “right out in meeting.”</p>

<p>“I will!” said Billy.</p>

solemncholy?” asked Somebody of the boy named Billy.</p>

<p>“Mother sent me away from the table
’cause I took my pie up in my fingers,” said
Billy. “Grandfather said that fingers were
made before forks, but Mother said perhaps
they were, but that didn’t excuse me
for forgetting my table manners. Who
made forks, anyhow? I <em>wish</em> they <em>hadn’t</em>.”</p>

<p>“Well, Son,” said Somebody, “had
you been born before the year 1600 it
would have been quite correct for you to
have eaten your meat from your fingers. But it was terribly
messy and there had to be a servant called a ewer-bearer
whose duty it was to pass around a basin of water and a
napkin with which to wash away the stains of the food. But
at last some bright Italian person hit upon the idea of copying
the large meat forks with which the roast was handled, and
making them small enough to be used individually. Visitors
to Italy were much interested in the fork.</p>

<p>“Many people thought it a useless invention and it was
the middle of the 17th century before the people of England
consented to use it. Queen Elizabeth was the first lady in
England to own a fork, and hers could not have been much
good as a table implement, as it was made of crystal, inlaid
with gold and set with sparks of garnets.</p>

<p>“The first forks were very small and narrow, with two
prongs, but after people got used to the idea they were made
larger. Silver knives and forks were first used in England in
1814 and could only be afforded by the very wealthy.”</p>

<p>“That’s interesting,” said the boy named Billy. “I’m
glad I didn’t have to learn to eat peas with those funny little
two-tined forks. I guess I’ll go and beg mother’s pardon.”</p>

<span class="hidden">“T</span>HIS is a piece of Sister’s new silk dress,” said
the boy named Billy. “It looks as though the
fairies had woven it out of cobwebs.”</p>

<p>“It was made by something more wonderful
than fairies, if that is possible,” said Somebody. “It was
spun by a queer little worm who needed it for his own slumber
robe, and had no idea in the world of giving it to sister for a
party dress.”</p>

<p>“You mean the silk-worm’s cocoon, of course,” said the
boy named Billy.</p>

<p>“About 4,500 years ago there was a Chinese Empress
whose name was Si-Ling-Shi, who used to spend a great deal
of time in her garden, and as she loved Nature very much she
became interested in the worms who lived on her mulberry
trees. There were so many of them, and the thread they spun
was so strong and beautiful that she thought if it could be
unrolled without being tangled or broken it could undoubtedly
be spun into a web.</p>

<p>“She knew if the chrysalis were left alive to emerge the
thread would be broken and spoiled, so she had some of the
cocoons devitalized and experiments proved her theories
correct.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>

<p>“The rest of the world tried hard to induce China to give
their secret of silk-making but to no avail, so the Emperor
Justinian sent some young monks to China to study and to get
the secret. After some years they went back to Constantinople
with enough eggs of the silk-worm butterfly in their
hollow pilgrim staffs to begin raising them.</p>

<p>“But even after they had the eggs it was not easy to raise
them as the children of Mr. and Mrs. Bombyx Mori can only
be raised where the mulberry tree will grow.”</p>

<p>“After they get the cocoons how do they get the silk
unwound?” asked the boy named Billy.</p>

<p>“That’s interesting,” said Somebody. “I had a chance
to see the process at the Panama Pacific Fair. When the
worm is ready to spin, and has shed his coat four times, he
is about three weeks old. Then he hangs himself on the limb
of the tree which has nourished him, and begins to spin. He
moves his head around for three whole days, spinning two
threads at the same time, until he is completely covered, when
he stops spinning and starts to transform. He has spun about
1,200 yards of double-threaded silk. Of course he must not
live to emerge so after three or four days he is put in a gently
heated oven until he is dead. Then he is immersed in hot
water and stirred with a long-handled brush until the ends of
the threads are loosened, when he is put into another pan of
hot water with several other cocoons and the ends of the
threads are passed through an eyelet to keep them from
tangling and are wound upon spools or reels into pale golden
skeins of what is called raw silk. Afterward it is bleached and
colored and woven into webs,” said Somebody.</p>

<p>“That’s got any fairy story beaten a mile,” said Billy.
“I’d really like to try out that process with Lady Luna’s
cocoon, but she is such a beauty after she comes out that it
would be too bad to destroy her.”</p>

<p>“Indeed it would,” said Somebody, “and we’ve got to
have beauty as well as utility in this world, Billy.”</p>

<p>“Sure,” said Billy grinning, but he understood.</p>

<span class="hidden">“S</span>TRAWBERRIES and cream for supper,” sang out
the boy named Billy, “wild ones. Got ’em over in
the clearing in the woods where the fire ran through
last year. Whoppers! I wonder how they ever got
there, and why do we call them strawberries? They are far
from being the color of straw. Just look at my hands.”</p>

<p>“Look at your face, too, Billy,” laughed Somebody.
“You surely did splash.”</p>

<p>“Guess I did,” said Billy, as he repaired the damage.
“I couldn’t resist those strawberries. Where did they get
the name from?”</p>

<p>“Nobody knows—at least nobody whom I have been
able to trace,” said Somebody. “I’ve always been interested
in that question myself, and I’ve consulted many authorities
and have found out just exactly as much as the two people
found out from each other in the early English rhyme, which
goes:</p>

<p class="verse2">“Ye manne of ye wildernesse asked me,</p>
<p class="verse3">How many strauberies growe in ye sea?</p>
<p class="verse2">I answer maybe as I thought goode</p>
<p class="verse3">As manie red herring as growe in ye woode.”</p>

<p>“That sounds as though they didn’t find out a blessed
thing,” said the boy named Billy.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>

<p>“Exactly,” laughed Somebody. “Izaak Walton’s tribute to the
strawberry in the ‘Compleat Angler’ is very well known. He said,
‘Doubtless God could have made a better berry, but doubtless
God never did.’ The only information I have been able to
gather is that ‘the strawberry is a perennial herb of the genus
fragaria, order of rosacea,’—that it ‘appears to have been a
native of Eastern North America where it appears as a common wild
strawberry.’ The strawberry seems to have been grown in gardens
less than six hundred years, for though knowledge of it goes back
to the time of Virgil, and perhaps earlier, it was not cultivated
by the people.</p>

<p>“The Germans have some beautiful legends concerning
it. It is said that the Goddess Frigga was very fond of the
fruit and that it was supposed to be her task to go with the
children to gather them on <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John’s day; and that on that
day no mother who had lost a little child would taste a strawberry
because if she did, the little one in Paradise could
have none; because the mother on earth had already had the
share belonging to it.</p>

<p>“The fairies in the West of England are very careful of
the strawberry crop and woe betide the one who picks the
blooms or the unripe fruit. The farmers are always careful
not to displease the fairies and always leave a great many
ripe berries for them, as they are known to be very fond of
them. The Bavarian farmer, knowing the capricious disposition
of the elves, is said to tie a basket of the ripe berries
between the horns of his cow so that they may sit and enjoy
them in comfort and also be more friendly toward the cow.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right interesting,” said the boy named Billy,
“but it doesn’t explain why there are berries in the clearing
in the wood now, where there never were any before, nor tell
us why they are called strawberries.”</p>

<p>“I fancy the birds and the winds could tell you how the
strawberry seeds came to the clearing in the wood,” said
Somebody; “and as for the other, let us keep our minds and
our ears open and perhaps we shall hear more about it in
some way or other.”</p>

<p>“I can hear something right now that satisfies me,”
said the boy named Billy; “that’s the dinner gong. Me for
wild strawberries and Jersey cream!”</p>

<span class="hidden">“W</span>HAT have you been doing all day that I have
not had even a glimpse of you?” asked Somebody,
as the boy named Billy came in, looking
rather hot and dusty, one Saturday afternoon in
June. “Better go bathe your face at my wash-stand
and then come and tell me what’s been so
interesting—baseball or fishing.”</p>

<p>“Neither baseball nor fishing,” said the boy
named Billy, “but it’s been lots of fun just the
same. I’ve been helping the ladies over at the
church put up the flags and bunting for decorations
and to fix up the pulpit with palms and
potted plants; Bob White’s been helping, too;
we’re the tallest boys in Sunday School. Tomorrow is Children’s
Day, you know. What’s the meaning of Children’s
Day and do they always have it? I don’t seem to remember
anything about it before this year.”</p>

<p>“That is because you are older now and able to help,”
said Somebody. “It used to be the custom for each church to
have Children’s Day at any time in the year that was most
convenient for them, but back in 1883 the Presbyterian
Church said, ‘This scattering Children’s Day all over the year
is not right and must stop—let’s all get together and agree
upon one particular day and keep that and celebrate it!’ And
all the other Churches saw the sense of that so they agreed on
June—the second Sunday in June, as being warm and sunny
weather with flowers blooming and everyone able to get out.”</p>

<p>“But where did the idea of Children’s Day come from?”
asked the boy named Billy.</p>

<p>“It probably grew out of that wonderful saying of Our
Savior: ‘Suffer little children to come unto me and forbid them
not, for of such is the kingdom of heaven,’” said Somebody.</p>

<p id="p60_cap"> <span class="hidden">“B</span>OB WHITE’S carrier
pigeon has lost its mate,” said the boy named Billy. “He won’t
eat or take any notice of anything—just sits humped up making
queer little sounds as if he were grieving. Do you suppose that
he realizes what has happened to the little mate?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not, in so many words,” said Somebody, “but
he misses her and realizes that things are different. It’s a
well-known fact that carrier pigeons never replace a lost
mate, which reminds me of a story I heard about pigeons,
out in Washington State, which might interest you.”</p>

<p>“Is it a <em>really-so story</em>?” asked Billy.</p>

<p>“Yes indeed,” said Somebody, “a really, truly-so story.
It was this way. There was a pigeon fancier in Seattle, who,
during the great war, raised carriers for the government, and
in order to train the young birds for use in the battle-fields,
he used to take them on the engine of the Shasta Limited
train, which is the fastest one going south out of Seattle,
down as far as Centralia, a small town on the line, where no
stop is made by the limited, and then to liberate them and
let them make their way back home.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>

<p>“One particularly beautiful and promising pair of black
and white birds had been in training for some time in this
way, when, in returning to the loft the little lady bird was
lost.”</p>

<p>“Some spy had shot her very likely,” said Billy.</p>

<p>“Well, as to that of course they never knew, it might
have been a hawk you know,” said Somebody, “but her mate
would not return home without her. He just flew between
the two places searching for her, but at last returned to the
place where he had seen her for the last time, at Centralia,
where a kind-hearted farmer who lived near the railroad
track fixed him up a cote, hoping that he might forget his
loss.</p>

<p>“The pathetic part of the story is in the fact that every
day when the Shasta Limited came along the little fellow
would fly to meet it, dropping until he was on a level with
the engine, and flying along with it for as long as he could
keep up, hoping that from the window of the engine his
little mate would come to meet him. Then he would return to
the farm house to wait until the next day.</p>

<p>“The train men were much interested in him, and always
gave him the signal that they were coming. He paid no attention
to any other train, but for a year, at the time I was there,
he had been meeting the Shasta every day.”</p>

<p>“Poor little fellow,” said the boy named Billy. “Did
you see him yourself?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I did,” said Somebody. “I chose that train on
purpose because I had heard the story in Seattle. When it
was time for the bird to appear the conductor of the train
came and told me about it and I watched for him. He came
straight as an arrow through the tree tops, and his flying
was beautiful to see, as he accommodated himself to the
swift flying train and its suction. At one time he was not
more than six inches above the track, but gradually gained
until he was on a level with the engineer’s cab.”</p>

<p>“Poor little fellow,” said the boy named Billy. “I hope
he forgot after awhile.”</p>

<p>“So do I,” said Somebody.</p>

<p class="verse0">Where a ray of sunshine never can be found,</p>
<p class="verse0">Digging dusky diamonds all the year around</p>
<p class="verse0">Down in a coal mine underneath the ground,”</p>

<p class="p00">sang the boy named Billy as he put more
coal on Somebody’s fire.</p>

<p>“Where <em>did</em> you dig up that old coal-miner’s
chantey, Billy Boy?” asked Somebody.</p>

<p>“Bob White’s great-grandfather sings
it sometimes in the funniest quivery old
voice ever—” said the boy named Billy.
“He used to be a foreman in a coal-mine in Pennsylvania when
he was young, so Bob says. What’s a Chantey, please? I
thought it was just a funny old song.”</p>

<p>“A Chantey is a song that workmen sing as they work,
and make up for themselves,” said Somebody. “Sometimes
they have a stanza to start with and then everybody adds a
little and after a time it takes on the character of the men
who sing it. The men who work in the woods, and the river
men, especially those of Canada, have wonderful Chanteys.”</p>

<p>“It’s very interesting,” said Billy, “why do they call coal
‘dusky diamonds’ in their chantey?”</p>

<p>“Because both coal and diamonds are carbon,” said
Somebody, “you knew that, Billy.”</p>

<p>“Guess I did,” said Billy, giving the fire an extra poke,
“only I didn’t stop to think. But I don’t believe I know just
exactly what makes them after all.”</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>

<p>“In the case of coal—pressure,” said Somebody. “This
old world of ours has been a long time in the making; at some
time in its history dense forests, which had been centuries in
growing, were crushed and buried by some disturbance of the
earth and under the mountains of earth and rocks were
pressed into a rock-like substance composed of carbon, oxygen,
nitrogen, and hydrogen, with sulphur and silica added. The
carbon and gases burn up, and what is left is what you take
away in the form of ashes before you go to school mornings,
like the good boy that you are.”</p>

<p>“Is coal everywhere under us then?” asked the boy named
Billy.</p>

<p>“Probably not,” answered Somebody. “It is usually
found in streaks, very likely because there was much open
country where no forests grew. Then, too, the moving glacier
or flood or whatever it was that destroyed the forests may have
taken them a long way from home before it buried them.”</p>

<p>“The coal we burn in the furnace is not like the sort that
you burn in your grate,” said the boy named Billy.</p>

<p>“The Anthracite, or hard coal which is used in furnaces,”
said Somebody, “is the kind that has been under most pressure
and is found at a greater depth than the Bituminous or
soft coal which is found nearer the surface.”</p>

<p>“Who was the first to find out that coal would burn?”
asked Billy.</p>

<p>“Nobody knows,” said Somebody. “Perhaps some little
mother whose babies were cold and chilly found some black
rocks and used them for a fireplace to hold the little sticks
which she was burning to cook breakfast over, and found that
the stones also burned.”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet that’s right,” said Billy. “I can just see the
picture. What kind of mother would she have been?”</p>

<p>“Anglo-Saxon,” said Somebody, “as they were the first
to use it as a fuel. They have been known to have used coal
since 842 A. D.”</p>

<p>“As useful as coal itself is, its derivatives are more so,”
went on Somebody. “From coal tar is made so many articles
of daily use that it would be impossible to tell you about
them all.”</p>

<p>“Old King Coal,” sang Billy. “Thanks, Somebody—I’m
off for a swift skate on the ice this morning!”</p>

it to,” said the boy named Billy.</p>

<p>“Let me help you,” said Somebody; “I’ll hold
it while you clamp it to the window-sill.”</p>

<p>“Just when did we begin to have Flag Day, please?”</p>

<p>“Flag Raising Day is one of the youngest of our National
anniversaries, but is fast becoming one of the most popular,”
said Somebody. “The custom came about at the request of
the Sons of the Revolution that a day be set aside for honoring
of the Flag, and was first observed on the 14th of June,
1894, on the 117th anniversary of the adoption of the Flag
by Congress, when the Governor of New York ordered it
to be flown on all public buildings in the State.”</p>

<p>“Please tell me just how the flag became,” said Billy.</p>

<p>“Previous to the year 1777,” said Somebody, “each state had
its own flag. But at a convention of the Revolutionary statesmen,
which was held in Philadelphia in that year, a committee was
appointed to consider the report upon the subject of a flag which
should be the standard of all the colonies; and on June 14th,
1777, Congress passed a resolution that the flag of our country
should bear thirteen stripes, one red and the other white, and
that the union should be thirteen white stars on a field of blue.
General George Washington, who was a member of the committee,
with Robert Morris and Colonel Ross, made a rough sketch of
the flag and took it to a Mrs. Betsy Ross who was famed for
her skillful needle work, asking her if she could make such a
flag.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>

<p>“I can,” said Mrs. Ross, “but a true star has but five
points, where yours has six,” and picking up her scissors she
deftly cut a five-pointed star. It was at once seen that the
star of five points was much more beautiful and the committee
commissioned Mrs. Ross to make a sample flag.</p>

<p>The first flag made was raised in Philadelphia, but was
soon copied and flown over the entire land.</p>

<p>“Where it still flies,” said the boy named Billy, saluting,
“and will always continue to fly. But when was it changed?
The field is now full of stars, though it has only thirteen
stripes.”</p>

<p>“When Kentucky and Vermont were admitted to the
Union,” said Somebody, “the flag was changed to fifteen stars
and fifteen stripes; but in 1818 Congress voted to restore
the thirteen stripes and to add a new star for every state,
on the first Fourth of July after the state had been admitted
to the Union.</p>

<p>“There is a story to the effect that at a Fourth of July
dinner given some years ago in Shanghai, the English Consul,
in toasting the British flag, said: ‘Here’s to the Union Jack,
the flag of flags, the flag that has floated on every continent
and every sea for a thousand years and upon which the sun
never sets.’”</p>

<p>“Did he get away with that?” asked Billy.</p>

<p>“Not very well,” said Somebody. “Eli Perkins, the
celebrated American humorist, who was present, rose to his
feet and said, “<em>Here’s</em> to the Stars and Stripes, emblem of
the New Republic. When the setting sun lights up its stars
in Alaska, the rising sun salutes it on the rockbound coast
of Maine. It is the flag of liberty, never lowered to any foe,
and the <em>only</em> flag that has ever whipped the flag upon which
the sun never sets.”</p>

<p>“I guess that held him for a while!” said the boy named
Billy, saluting.</p>

<span class="hidden">“W</span>HAT are you reading, Billy
Boy, all alone to yourself?” asked Somebody one evening after
supper.</p>

<p>“Story about an old grey and white sea-gull that got
mixed up with some crude oil which a ship had thrown out,
and got his feathers so covered with it that he could neither
swim nor fly,” answered the boy named Billy, “and how some
children fed him and took care of him until he got a new coat
of feathers; he was sure in a bad fix, only for their kindness.”</p>

<p>“I was reading in a book about birds the other day,”
said Big Sister, “that the gull is a protected bird, but it did
not state why. I suppose on account <a id="beauty"></a>of its beauty, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Not entirely,” said Somebody. “They are splendid
scavengers, and are protected on that account—your friend
the gull who got into trouble, Billy, was very likely following
the vessel for the things thrown out from the kitchen—but
outside of that they ought to be protected on account of
their grace and beauty and the life and movement that they
give to the upper air. They are, as far as I know, the only
birds in the world to have a monument erected to them, and
not a small one either but a great shaft of granite.”</p>

<p>“Oh, say, Somebody,” said the boy named Billy, “you’re
so much better than any story book—what about these
wonderful birds?”</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>

<p>“It was like this,” said Somebody. “When the Mormons went
all the way across the sands of the desert, to improve the land
on the shores of the Great Salt Lake in Utah, they met with
many hardships and discouragements. After two years, when they
had succeeded in getting water on the land, had planted things
that were growing beautifully, and even had fields of waving
grain which they were looking forward to harvesting, young fruit
orchards started and vegetables growing, it seemed like a dream
come true.”</p>

<p>“I’ll say so,” said the boy named Billy.</p>

<p>“Well, then,” said Somebody, “just as they had all those
things and were as happy as could be, waiting for harvest
time, and working at building more homes, along came a plague
of black crickets, and began to devour every growing thing in
sight. The crickets ate anything and everything. When the
fields no longer looked promising they began on the clothing
and bedding. It was impossible to hang out the family washing,
because a drove of these hungry crickets would swoop
down on it and leave a trail of gnawed holes.</p>

<p>“The people fought the pests with every weapon they
had, but it did no good, and they had to simply stand by and
see everything eaten and destroyed.</p>

<p>“When everything they knew of had been done, there
was sent out a call for the people to come into the middle of
town for prayer that the scourge might be lifted.</p>

<p>“All day long they prayed—and just before evening there
came a white cloud from the west which proved to be <em>millions</em>
of sea-gulls, every one of which had brought along a perfectly
good appetite for black crickets, and before you could say
Jack Robinson there wasn’t a single cricket left to tell the
tale. Right then and there, those poor Mormon farmers
turned the prayer meeting into a day of Thanksgiving.</p>

<p>“In fact, so thankful were they that they built in Temple
Square in Salt Lake City a beautiful granite monument called
The Monument To The Sea-Gulls, and declared the sea-gull
to be the sacred bird of Utah forever.”</p>

<p>“Well, <em>could</em> you blame ’em?” said the boy named Billy.</p>

<p>“Not much like the unsafe and insane Fourth your Dad
and I used to have when we were youngsters,” grinned
Uncle Ned. “We had real gunpowder those days.”</p>

<p>“Dad’s told me all about it,” said Billy. “It must have
been loads of fun. I like a big noise as well as anybody, but
I sort of like to be all in one piece when I take the count at
bedtime, and Dad has always missed that finger of his a lot—that
middle one he lost the Fourth just after he was nine
years old.”</p>

<p>“Guess I do know,” said Uncle Ned. “I carried him in
to Mother, and I’ll never forget how she looked, either.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the boy named Billy, “when it comes to
having fun that would make Mom sorry I’ll go without the
fun.”</p>

<p>“You’re all right, Billy Boy,” said Somebody, who had
been listening to the conversation, “those old fellows did not
have half the fun they think they did.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the boy named Billy, “she’s a grand old
country and I’ll help celebrate her birthday every time, but
I’m glad that they pay more attention to us boys nowadays
and let us have hikes and scout suits and drills and everything.
It would be hard to find a place where a boy can have
a better time just being a boy, than in this good old Land
o’ the Free—don’t you think?”</p>

<p>“’Deed and I do, Billy Boy, think just that!” said
Somebody.</p>

<p>“Somebody, what is in the Declaration of Independence?”</p>

<p>“Compton’s Pictured Encyclopedia gives it briefly,” said
Somebody. “‘We hold these truths to be self-evident, that
all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their
Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are
life, liberty and pursuit of happiness. That to secure these
rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their
just powers from the consent of the governed; that, whenever
any form of government becomes destructive to these ends, it
is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute
a new government, laying its foundation on such principles,
and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem
most likely to effect their safety and happiness—</p>

<p>“‘We, therefore—do solemnly publish and declare, That
these United Colonies are, and of right ought to be, Free and
Independent States; that they are absolved from all allegiance
to the British crown, and that all political connection between
them and the State of Great Britain is, and ought to be, totally
dissolved; and that as free and independent States, they have
full power to levy war, conclude peace, contract alliances,
establish commerce and do all other acts and things which
independent States may of right do. And for the support of
this declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of
Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our lives,
our fortunes, and our sacred honor.’”</p>

<span class="hidden">“O</span>H, GOODY,” said the boy named Billy.
“Baked potatoes for supper—I can smell
them—I am certainly grateful to Old
Ireland for sending us her wonderful
potatoes. I’m going to have cream on
mine and eat every bit of the jacket.”</p>

<p>“So shall I,” said Somebody, laughing. “I don’t know of
anything more appetizing than a big well-baked potato, but I
must tell you, Billy Boy, that the cause for gratitude is the
other way around—Ireland has America to thank for potatoes.
But we surely owe her a vote of thanks for showing us what a
useful article of food we were neglecting to use.”</p>

<p>“Why! Where did the potato come from if not from
Ireland—they’re always spoken of as Irish Potatoes—” said
the boy named Billy.</p>

<p>“The botanical books have this to say about it,” said
Somebody. “Potato—Solanum tuberosa—a native of Chile,
Peru, and the Rocky Mountains of North America.</p>

<p>“The potato was taken to England from America in the
early part of the 16th century by Sir Francis Drake who saw
in it a valuable food for cattle. But when the grain crops
failed in 1772 the people, especially those in Ireland, began
to grow the potato extensively for food for the people, and
as it was so easily raised it soon became very popular, and
was eagerly adopted by the Irish as their very own.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>

<p>“In the United States the growing of early potatoes for
northern markets is an important industry as far south as
Florida and the Bermudas; but potatoes flourish best in
climates which are just too cool for corn. There is a belt of
120,000,000 acres, running from Newfoundland, maritime
Canada, and New England, through New York, Pennsylvania,
and the American and Canadian Lake region, and by
way of the Yukon Valley almost into the Arctic Circle, where
potatoes have been found amazingly productive. The giant
Idaho and Montana potatoes, which often weigh several
pounds, are favorites for baking.</p>

<p>“Growing from seed seldom produces satisfactory
potatoes, but seedsmen plant them in the hope of discovering
new and desirable varieties, as did Burbank when he grew from
seed the potato which bears his name. There are now perhaps
a thousand well-developed varieties, while at the time of the
American Revolution there were only two, the red and the
white. In growing potatoes, the most perfect tubers should be
chosen, cut in pieces and planted; the new plants grow from
the eyes or buds on the cuttings.</p>

<p>“The cultivation of the potato has played an important
part in the history of Europe. In certain parts of Germany it
helped to check the famines caused by the Thirty Years’ War.
By 1688 it had become the staple food of the Irish peasantry,
and the failure of the potato crop in 1845 and the resulting
famine started the first great wave of Irish immigration to the
United States.”</p>

<p>“I was reading an old poem about that Irish famine the
other day,” said the boy named Billy, “where a little boy
was begging his mother for just one grain of corn—I felt so
sorry for him, but I can see now that he suffered hunger so
that all the other children in the world might have good food
all their lives—I hope someone gave him a nice hot baked
potato before he got too hungry. There’s the dinner gong—Hurrah
for the Irish!”</p>

<p>“Hurrah for us, too!” said Somebody.</p>

<p>“Sure,” said the boy named Billy.</p>

<span class="hidden">“T</span>EACHER was reading to the class about Old Abe,
the war Eagle, today,” said the boy named Billy.</p>

<p>“What about him,” asked Big Sister, “I do
not remember anything about him in my
United States History.”</p>

<p>“Teacher said he was not really
historical—just an incident in the history
of the Civil War, but he is most interesting,”
said the boy named Billy. “He
went through three years of the war and
was in the thick of every battle, where he seemed to be having
the time of his life, understanding which side he belonged to
very well indeed. One day when the Confederate soldiers had
been told by their officers to ‘get that old bird’ and they were
all firing on him as hard as they possibly could, Old Abe went
up in the air and stayed there circling ’round and ’round—screaming
his head off, and when the battle was over he went
back to his standard minus a few feathers but still all in one
piece, as Big Brother says.”</p>

<p>“Wherever did they get him?” asked Big Sister.</p>

<p>“Some people say Old Abe was caught in the spring of
1861 on the banks of the Flambeau River in Wisconsin when
the Indians were making their maple sugar, by the son of
Chief Thunder-Of-Bees. He climbed to the top of the tall
tree where the Eagles had their nest and took the baby bird
out when the old ones were away. Others say that he chopped
the tree down and had a fight with the old birds, but finally
escaped with the little one who was then about as large as a
hen. Anyway he got him, and took him home to the children,
where he became quite one of the family, until when it was
planting time Chief Sky sold him for a bushel of seed corn.
A man named Mills then bought him from his owner for five
dollars and presented him to a Company of young volunteers
who were organizing to go to the front.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>

<p>“The boys thought Mr. Eagle was great fun, and they
made him enlist, by putting the colors around his neck and
a shield on his breast so that he was really a living United
States Emblem. Then they christened him ‘Old Abe’ in
honor of the president, and made a standard for him, and
after that wherever his regiment, the 8th Wisconsin, went,
there was Old Abe in all his glory, so that the regiment became
known as the Eagle Regiment.</p>

<p>“After the war he was taken back to Madison where
he had started from three long years before, and was given a
perch in the Capitol where he held a reception every day.
P. T. Barnum wanted to buy him and so did many others,
but he could not be purchased. There wasn’t money enough
in the world to buy him.</p>

<p>“In the winter of 1864-5 he was taken to the big fair at
Chicago where his photographs were sold for the benefit of
sick and wounded soldiers, and he earned in that way 16,000
dollars. In 1876 he was taken to the Centennial Exposition
at Philadelphia where he was greatly admired, and when
that was over he was taken home again to his perch in the
State Capitol at Madison.</p>

<p>“In 1881 the bird died of old age and the people of Madison
had his skin stuffed and mounted on his old perch. There Old
Abe stood, looking every inch a war eagle and a hero, until
the State House burned.”</p>

<p>“That is a very interesting story,” said Somebody.</p>

<p>“It is in a book called ‘The Great Seal’ by a Mr. J.
Cigrand,” said the boy named Billy. “I’m going to read it
all when I can read a little better.”</p>

<span class="hidden">“L</span>OOK at my new wrist-watch! Mom
gave it to me for my birthday—isn’t
it a beauty?” said the boy
named Billy. “Radium dial ’n all; I can see
what time it is in the dark. Handy when I’m
on hikes, no more stopping to scratch matches.
Stem winder ’n everything.”</p>

<p>“Goodness, Billy,” said Big Sister. “Anyone
would think to hear you that there never
was a watch like that of yours. We all have
watches.”</p>

<p>Billy grinned. “Well,” he said, “I’ve wanted
it so long. A fellow <em>needs</em> something to tell
time by. Who discovered how to tell time
anyhow?”</p>

<p>“The first Caveman, probably,” said Somebody. “He
needed to let the ladies of the family know when he was
coming home to dinner, so he very likely pointed to the sun,
and drew a line in the sand, to tell them that when the sunshine
reached that spot he would be home and that dinner
better be forthcoming pronto! That was the sundial idea,
which was the only way of time-telling for ages. Cleopatra’s
needle is supposed to have been one of the big sun dials.
But as it was certainly inconvenient not to be able to tell
the time on dark days, it was only a matter of time when
some more convenient method of recording the hours would
be found. When it did appear it was in the shape of the
clepsydra, or water thief, a brass bowl with a hole in the
bottom, which was floated on top of another bowl full of
water, the principle being that when the bowl had filled itself
with water an hour had passed, then a slave would empty
the bowl, and hit it with a rod to announce the hour.”</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>

<p>“But someone must have sat up all night to watch the
bowl and strike the hours,” said the boy named Billy.</p>

<p>“Precisely,” said Somebody, “so they consulted the
stars, and discovered that they could divide the night into
‘watches’ of so many hours duration, and then they had
different watchmen to sit up with the clepsydra, and announce
the hours.</p>

<p>“The Priests of Babylon were very wise men indeed,
and it was not long until they had figured out how to divide
the years into months and weeks and days and hours and
minutes and seconds.</p>

<p>“But it was not until 1581 that a young Spaniard, standing
in the Cathedral of Pisa discovered, by watching a swinging
lamp, the principle of the pendulum. He noticed that when
it moved a short distance, it moved slowly, and that the
farther it moved, the faster became the motion, making the
long swing in the same time as it did the shorter one. And
in this way was the pendulum applied to the making of time-telling
machines.</p>

<p>“In the 12th Century there were clocks which struck the
hours, but which had no dials or hands, but after the idea
of time-telling machines started it traveled fast, and in the
14th Century real clocks began to appear.</p>

<p>“We have not time to go through the whole fascinating
story of how the idea progressed, but we know that in Shakespeare’s
time there were watches that could be carried in the
pocket.”</p>

<p>“Why were they called ‘watches’ instead of clocks,”
asked the boy named Billy.</p>

<p>“The clock, or orloge, as they were then called, struck
the hours, and the watch was very probably so named from
the silent ‘watches of the night’,” said Somebody. “That
last is just a guess, but it’s as good as anybody’s guess at
that.”</p>

<p>“Who made the first clock in America?” asked the boy
named Billy.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>

<p>“Eli Terry did, in the year 1809,” said Somebody,
“and after a time he got Seth Thomas to help him. As
soon as people realized what a very great convenience it
was to be able to keep accurate time, nobody wanted to be
without a clock. And then people began to travel more and
needed to have something portable with which to tell time, and
so the convenient watches came to be made.</p>

<p>“‘What time is it?’ you ask. Centuries of scientific
progress, with vast labor and years of patient study, have been
necessary to answer that question. You’ll find that men had
to delve into mathematics, the mysteries of astronomy, the
wonders of physics and chemistry, before they could force the
hands on the dial to tell you when to start for school or to
catch your train. As you look at a clock, remember that every
time the minute-hand passes from one of its marks to the next,
it shows that this huge globe on which we live has covered
more than 1,000 miles of its headlong journey.</p>

<p>“And then along came Madame Curie, the brilliant French
scientist, and discovered radium, the merest shadow of which
makes the dial of your watch luminous for as long as it lasts.</p>

<p>“There is a very famous clock in Strasbourg which not
only tells the time of day, but also the day of week, the month,
and the position of the moon and the planets. At various
times processions of tiny figures cross a stage, including a
cock that crows. The day of week is indicated by a separate
little figure which takes its place on a tiny platform.</p>

<p>“A watch is perhaps the most wonderful little machine
in the world. Packed in a case sometimes no bigger than a
twenty-five cent piece and less than a quarter of an inch
thick are from one hundred and fifty to eight hundred separate
parts. And there you are, Billy Boy!”</p>

<p>“Time for bed,” said Mother. “And don’t linger too long
admiring your new watch or it will be time to get up.”</p>

<p>“Goodnight everybody, and Somebody,” said the boy
named Billy, “and thanks again, Mom, for the watch. I’ve
never before had such a jimdandy birthday gift.”</p>

<p class="p00">sang the boy named Billy.</p>

<p>“Wherever did you dig up that old Dixie song?” Somebody
asked, smiling. “I haven’t heard it in years.”</p>

<p>“Bob White’s Grandfather is always singing it,” said the
boy named Billy, “and we play soldier to it—it has such a
dandy swing to it—listen:</p>

<p class="verse22">“‘In Dixie Land I’ll take my stand</p>
<p class="verse3">To live and die for Dixie—Look away—</p>
<p class="verse3">Look away—look away down South in Dixie’</p>
<p class="verse0">—it’s an old war song, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“It is one of the old negro melodies which the boys
adopted as a marching song in the Civil War,” said Somebody,
“and very dear to the hearts of everyone from the
‘land of cotton’.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been meaning to ask something about cotton—Teacher
says that if coal is king in America cotton is easily
queen. I did not know before that it was so important—I
thought you just made house dresses and aprons of it. Bob
White says that when he was down South with his folks last
winter the fields were all blossomed out white and the people
were picking the flowers.”</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>

<p>“Bob should have asked questions about it,” said Somebody,
“and in that way he would have found out that the
white ‘blooms’ were in reality the ripened cotton, or boll, as
it is called. When the cotton has gone to seed it is ready to
be picked, and if left to itself would in time blow away in
the winds, scattering its seeds just as old Grandfather dandelion
does his.</p>

<p>“But it is far too valuable to be left to do that, so it is
carefully picked and prepared for market; but valuable as
the fibre, the seed, which is deeply embedded in the cotton,
is almost more so. But the seed is very hard to get at, and
before the cotton gin was invented by Eli Whitney it was a
year’s work for one person to clean the seeds from enough
cotton to make one bale, but now with the machinery they
have it is easy to prepare many bales in one day.”</p>

<p>“Where did it come from?” asked Billy.</p>

<p>“Most of it,” said Somebody, “came from our own
Southern States, but it has been grown in Asia and Egypt for
centuries, being one of the oldest plants on record.”</p>

<p>“What are some of the uses of cotton?” asked Billy.</p>

<p>“They are so many I couldn’t begin to tell you,” said
Somebody, “but all our bed linen is made from it, as well as
most of our curtains, and underwear and the dainty things
Little Sister wears, as well as the lovely voile dresses that
make Mother look like a bunch of posies. It is indispensable
for bandages and pads to dress wounds with and for
many other things.”</p>

<p>“I think it’s wonderful,” said the boy named Billy, “how
many of the things that we use every day just grow.”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” said Somebody, “Mother Nature has put
everything we could possibly need, in this good old world
of ours, and expects us to use our brains to find out just how
to use them.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, Somebody,” said the boy named Billy, “I’m
going over to tell Bob White all about those wonderful cotton
flowers he thinks he saw!”</p>

returned from California,” said the boy named Billy, “and has
brought Big Sister a necklace of very beautiful coral beads; not
a bit like the dark red branchy looking ones that she has had
since she was a baby! These are rose pink with little hand-carved
roses all over them. What sort of a stone is coral, and where is
it found? It’s lovely!”</p>

<p>“Strictly speaking,” said Somebody, “although coral has
all the appearance of stone it isn’t that at all, although it is
just as dangerous to a ship to run aground on a reef of it as
it would be to run on the rocks—it’s so jagged and sharp. It
is really the bones you might say of living creatures which
made their homes in that particular spot for ages and dying
have left their skeletons behind them for a monument.</p>

<p>“These little sea animals are called polyps and the coral
grows inside their soft outer structure just as your bones do
inside your flesh. Among the greatest architects in the world
are the little coral-making animals, creatures of shallow water
in the warmer seas. Some kinds live all alone, but the commoner
ones live in colonies of many individuals united by a
stalk with many branches—sort of a family tree you might
say—indeed they were once called plant animals. They have
a very helpful and economical way of living,” went on Somebody,
“for when something good to eat swims or floats within
reach of one little polyp’s mouth he sucks it in, swallows it,
and all his hungry relatives get the benefit of it.”</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>

<p>“That’s what I’d call being real chummy,” said the boy
named Billy. “How do they manage that?”</p>

<p>“They have a sort of family stomach,” said Somebody,
“or reservoir into which all food absorbed by the colony goes.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe I’d like that very well,” said Billy.
“One fellow might have to eat all the things he didn’t care
about and another would get all the pie.”</p>

<p>“I do not suppose the polyp has much to boast of in the
way of the sense of taste,” laughed Somebody, “but you’ve
got to admit that he does his duty as he sees it without
shirking.”</p>

<p>“I should say he does,” said Billy. “What else does he
do besides working for the good of his family?”</p>

<p>“He has a quite important hand in making the ‘beauteous
land,’” said Somebody. “The Great Barrier Reef of
Australia, extending a thousand miles along the coast and in
some places from one to three miles wide, was made entirely
by the Polyps. Also the keys of Florida, as well as the Everglades,
are made entirely upon coral foundation.”</p>

<p>“That is very interesting,” said the boy named Billy.
“But if there is so much of it why is it so expensive?”</p>

<p>“There’s only one kind that is precious,” said Somebody.
“That is the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">corallium rubrum</i> of the Mediterranean Sea. It
was once supposed to be endowed with sacred properties
of a mysterious nature; the Mandarins of China wear coral
buttons made from it as their badge of office. There is also
a very rare black coral which makes its home in the warm
water of the Great Australian Barrier Reef. The Italians are
the greatest coral workers, making a most valuable industry
of making jewelry and buttons and other small articles.</p>

<p>“There’s a lot more to learn about this subject, but that’s
all I am able to tell you just now,” said Somebody.</p>

<p>“Thanks,” said the boy named Billy. “I’ll read up on it.”</p>

but others claim it for John Stafford Smith, who made
it over from an old French composition. Anyway, it was
used as a popular song in England for some years and was
used in other ways also.</p>

<p>“In 1798 it was used by Robert Treat Paine in a political
way, for a song called ‘Adams and Liberty.’</p>

<p>“Everyone knows how the words came to be written.
It was in the Summer of 1814 when we were at war with
England; the British under General Ross appeared in the
vicinity of Washington and after overcoming feeble resistance
took the capital and set fire to the White House and some other
public buildings. The President and the Cabinet fled, while
pretty Dolly Madison bundled up the most precious White
House treasures, including Washington’s picture and the
original draft of the Declaration of Independence and carried
them to safety. Then the British prepared to bombard Baltimore
from the sea and attack it from the land side. Francis
Scott Key was sent with a friend to the British Fleet to get a
prisoner of war. As the British were about to attack the town
and the Fort he was not allowed to return, and you may
imagine how anxiously he watched for the dawn to come and
with what joy, when the mists rolled away that he beheld the
starry banner still flying from the fort. With the tears of
thankfulness streaming down his cheeks he wrote the first
stanza of his now world-famous song and later in the day, when
he had returned to the city, he finished the poem.</p>

<p>“It was first printed under the name of ‘The Bombardment
of Fort McHenry,’ in the Baltimore American and immediately
became very popular.”</p>

<p>“It’s a great song,” said the boy named Billy, “but I
think almost anyone could have written a great song under
those conditions—if he could write at all.”</p>

<p>“Yes indeed,” agreed Somebody.</p>

<span class="hidden">“I</span>T’S raining, Billy,” called Mother
from upstairs, “take your umbrella
when you go to school.”</p>

<p>“O Mother, <em>please</em>” said the boy
named Billy, “I just <em>hate</em> to carry an umbrella—<em>whoever</em>
invented the old things anyway?”</p>

<p>“I guess old Mr. Toad invented the idea
when he hunched under the first toadstool; and
next after him was an honorable Chinese gentleman
who got his idea from the branches of the
umbrella tree.</p>

<p>“In olden times no one but those of royal
family were allowed to use the umbrella, and
then only as a protection from the sun, as they
were made only of the daintiest silks and
brocades, and even of rice paper,” said Somebody.</p>

<p>“It did not seem to occur to anyone that it could be used
as a protection against the rain until early in the eighteenth
century, when it was introduced in England. Even then
people hesitated to use it on account of the ridicule it called
forth.”</p>

<p>“So you see,” said the boy named Billy, “I’ve got a good
right not to like to carry one.”</p>

<p>“M-m—yes,” said Somebody. “Only you will observe,
that as soon as people began to really realize what a very sensible
article it was and how much it saved them in the way
of spoiled clothes, not to mention damp shoulders, of course
they didn’t mind at all what a few foolish ones thought who
did not know a good thing when they saw it.”</p>

<p>“Time for school, Billy,” called Mother, “and never mind
taking your umbrella—the rain is over.”</p>

Sister, one crisp autumn day.</p>

<p>“Going to make a Jack O’Lantern of
it,” said the boy named Billy.</p>

<p>“Somebody, why do we dress up and make
believe we’re a lot of witches on Hallowe’en when we know
there is nothing like that in the world?”</p>

<p>“All Hallow Eve,” said Somebody, “is the name given
to the vigil of Hallowmas, which falls on the night before the
Feast of All Saints Day. The Ancients lighted bonfires on
that night to scare away ghosts and witches.</p>

<p>“The Romans had a festival in honor of Pomona, the
goddess of fruits, in which apples featured, which accounts for
the custom of bobbing for apples in tubs of water, which to
this day the young folks think is so much fun.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right for girls,” said the boy named Billy,
“but regular fellows can find something better to do.”</p>

<p>“What, for instance?” asked Big Sister.</p>

<p>“Oh, making Jack O’ Lanterns, and playing tricks on
other fellows,” said Billy.</p>

<p>“I know a fine trick that a lot of husky chaps like you
and Bob White and your gang could play on another fellow,”
said Somebody.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Billy. “We’re game for almost anything
that you could suggest.”</p>

<p>“Old Grandsire Johnson, who lives all alone in that little
house at the edge of town, has just had his winter’s coal delivered,”
said Somebody. “I think it would be fine if the
Hallowe’en spirits would go up there while he is at prayer
meeting tonight and put it all in the shed for him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, fine,” said the boy named Billy. “I know a bunch
of healthy spooks that would just love a little job like that.”</p>

I found in that funny old horse-hair trunk in

look like toys, and seem about big enough for
little sister. Nobody ever could have really used them to
skate with, could they?”</p>

<p>“Those skates were your great-grandmother Ellen’s
racing skates,” said Somebody, “and if they had not been
rather practical and not at all the toys they look, in comparison
with the ones in use now, you would not be here this
afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Why?” demanded the boy named Billy, sensing a story.</p>

<p>“Your great-grandmother Ellen,” said Somebody, “was
considered to have been the most expert skater, the most
fearless rider, and the most popular young lady in the section
of the country where she grew up,
and on the day of which I am speaking,
she had one of the most thrilling
adventures ever staged anywhere,
not excepting the movies.”</p>

  <div class="caption">TIMBER-WOLF!</div>
</div>

<p>“A <em>really-so story</em>!” exclaimed
the boy named Billy, “and in the
family, too!”</p>

<p>“It was many, many years ago,” said Somebody, “and happened
away up in the wilds of Maine, where your great-great-grandfather
lived with his family on the farm which he had taken away from
the forest.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>

<p>“Nobody lived at the head of the lake, which was long and
narrow and more like a river in appearance, except your
great-great-grandfather and his sons and daughters; but half
way down, about ten miles, there was a small village, where the
post-office was and where the young people of the surrounding
country used to gather for their dances and good times. So one
day in winter, when great-grandmother Ellen was about seventeen
years old, she started out early to skate down to the settlement
to a party. The party proved entertaining, and also the farewells
detained her, and she was dismayed to see that just as she was
getting her last skate-strap firmly fastened, the sun was going
down behind the tall hemlock trees.</p>

<p>“Ten of the thirty minutes it would take her to skate
home had gone and all was well, then far behind her she heard
the long-drawn hunting call of the timber wolf.</p>

<p>“A few moments later, almost parallel with her, there
broke from the forest a pack of the hunger-stricken beasts.
Instantly the girl swerved in a skilful zigzag—and instantly
the wolves swerved in the same direction—their long claws
slipping on the ice as they swerved. On they came again and
again. Sometimes they were so near that their snapping jaws
almost caught her skirts, and to gain time she managed to
unwind her long wool scarf, which she allowed to float behind
her, to be seized and torn to pieces, which gave her a moment’s
advantage. Then, just as she was wondering how much longer
she could go on there were shots, and the pack scattered, leaving
behind several of their number.”</p>

<p>“What happened?” asked the boy named Billy.</p>

<p>“The men, coming in from work, discovered Ellen was
late, and one remembered he heard wolves down the lake.
He picked up his rifle and skated down to meet his sister.”</p>

<p>“May I have these skates?” asked Billy. “I like to look
at them and remember that they belonged to a real girl. I’ll
hang them on my wall.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure that great-grandmother Ellen would be very
happy to have them belong to you, Billy. You’re just the kind
of boy that she would have approved of,” said Somebody.</p>

<span class="hidden">“G</span>OBBLE, gobble, gobble,” said Mr. Turkey Cock
proudly spreading his wonderful turkey tail fan
and looking as pompous as no one but he can look.</p>

<p>“Oh, you funny, conceited bird,” said the
boy named Billy, “you won’t be so noisy next
Thursday when we have you for Thanksgiving
dinner. But that reminds me—won’t somebody
please tell me why the turkey is called
our National bird? I thought it was the eagle.
And why do we always have Thanksgiving Day
on Thursday?”</p>

<p>“Well, you see, Son,” said Somebody, “it started this
way. As you of course know, our Pilgrim Fathers and
Mothers came over in the Mayflower and landed on Plymouth
Rock on November 21st, 1620; just one hundred and two
brave souls in a strange land, full of strange people who
might well resent their being there. Although it was late
in the year and cold weather, they managed to build themselves
houses of a sort; but with the best that they could do
more than half of them perished that first terrible winter.</p>

<p>“When Spring came, those who were left, with the help
of the Indians, bravely planted the crops and started to
make a home in the wilderness. The Indians gave them corn
for seed and taught them how to plow the land and fertilize
it, and with the seed that they had brought with them they
managed so well that when harvest time came they had a
bountiful yield. To express their gratitude to God who had
so marvelously prospered them, as well as to show their
friendliness to the Indians, Governor Bradford issued a proclamation
to the effect that they would have a Thanksgiving
feast to which Chief Massasoit and his braves were to be
invited, which should last from Thursday morning until
Saturday night. That was in October, 1621.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>

<p>“But the Pilgrim Mothers, remembering the harvest
festivals of England, with the barbecued sheep and oxen
which they used to have, said ‘How can we make a feast?
We have no meat.’ ‘Meat,’ said Governor Bradford, ‘why
the woods are full of it.’ So he sent four of his very best
riflemen out into the forest for wild turkeys, and they brought
back so many that there was enough meat for the three days
feasting for the colonists and their guests, the Indians. And
ever since then no Thanksgiving feast could be really right
without a nice plump turkey.”</p>

<p>“Did the Indians like the feast?” asked the boy named
Billy. “Indeed they did,” said Somebody; “they liked it
so well that Chief Massasoit sent his young men back with
a gift of nice fat deer which they had shot especially for the
colonists. Chief Massasoit wanted to show Governor Bradford
that the Indians knew how to play fairly.”</p>

<p>“So that’s how Thanksgiving became,” said the boy
named Billy.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Somebody, “but it was a long time
after that before it became the good old holiday that we
know now.</p>

<p>“In the first year of his office, President George Washington
issued a proclamation recommending that November 26,
1789, be kept as a day of “national thanksgiving” for the
establishment of a form of government that made for safety
and happiness. After that, it was only held at odd times, but
in 1863 it became a National holiday and the last Thursday
in November is always proclaimed by the President as a
day of prayer and thanksgiving.”</p>

<p>“We’re going to have the whole family here for dinner
this year,” said the boy named Billy; “and we’re going to
have turkey and cranberry jelly and pumpkin pie ’n’ everything.”</p>

<p>“<em>Gobble</em>, gobble, gobble,” remarked Mr. Turkey Cock.</p>

<p>“We shall!” remarked the boy named Billy, laughing.</p>

<p class="verse0">Let nothing you dismay,</p>
<p class="verse0">Remember Christ our Savior</p>
<p class="verse0">Was born on Christmas day,”</p>

<p class="p0">sang the boy named Billy, a bit off key. “<em>Billy</em>”
begged Big Sister, “please get that correctly—you’ll
throw the whole choir off if you sing it that way—come to the
piano and I’ll drill you until you can <em>sing</em> it!”</p>

<p>“Run along now, you’re letter perfect,” said Big Sister
after a half-hour of practice, “I’m going to wrap up my gifts
now, and it’s no fair peeking, either.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t care anything about your gifts,” said
Billy, “I’m going to stay right here and Somebody is going
to tell me all about Christmas and why we give gifts and
everything. Was it because the wise men brought gifts to
the baby Jesus?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” said Somebody, “but it seems more likely
that it grew out of the realization of God’s great gift to the
world—the gifts of Love and Friendliness and Peace which
He bestowed upon us in sending His only son to teach us
how to live.”</p>

<p>“‘Peace on earth, good will toward men,’” quoted Billy
softly. “That’s enough to make people happy.”</p>

<p>“Christmas was not always the happy time that it is
now,” said Somebody. “The early Christians had rather a
hard time of it.”</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>

<p>“I remember,” said the boy named Billy, “I never could
understand how they had the courage to keep it up.”</p>

<p>“They were upholding Truth,” said Somebody, “and
Truth is the strongest thing in the world.”</p>

<p>“Was Christ really born on December 25th?” asked
Billy.</p>

<p>“Probably not,” said Somebody. “The Eastern church
celebrated January 6th, as the date of birth, calling it Epiphania,
while the Western church celebrated December 25th,
calling it Natalis. The Pagans had a festival at this season
of the year called <span class="smcap">The Birthday of the Sun</span> of which
they were very fond. Out of this grew the idea of using that
time to celebrate the birth of Christ, the spiritual Sun of the
world. This gradually took the place of the old pagan
festival.”</p>

<p>“The singing of Christmas songs is an English custom,
is it not?” asked Billy.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Somebody. “There are many beautiful old-world
customs which were left behind when the Puritans
came to the new world in search of a place in which to
worship in their own way.</p>

<p>“In Devonshire, England, it is said that the bees sing
all night long in their hives the night before Christmas, and
if you are wise you will go and wish them a Merry Christmas
and hang a bit of holly on each hive, else you may get no
honey next year.</p>

<p>“And you must on no account ask to borrow a match
or a bit of fire on Christmas day, because fire is the symbol
of the heart of the house and of happiness, and you must
always add to and not take away from the happiness of
others.</p>

<p>“In spite of the Puritan’s striving to leave behind them
all the old legends, several did survive. I remember that
one Christmas Eve when I was a small child, my mother
being away at a party, I was taken at midnight out to
the stable to see the cattle, who were supposed to be on
their knees, worshipping the child who was born in a manger.”</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>

<p>“And were they?” asked the boy named Billy.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t really say,” said Somebody, “but they all
scrambled to their feet when they saw the light of the lantern,
and asked for clover hay. It seemed to me that we had disturbed
their slumbers!</p>

<p>“In Norway is a most beautiful old custom that might
well be copied everywhere,” went on Somebody, “which is
called ‘The Ceremony of Feeding the Birds.’ Two or three
days before Christmas bunches of oats are placed on the
roofs and tied to the branches of trees and shrubs, loads of
grain being brought into the towns for the purpose. And
no one would dream of sitting down to his own dinner without
first giving every animal on the place an extra portion in the
name of Christ.”</p>

<p>“How did the Christmas-tree custom first begin?” asked
Billy. “There is a tale to the effect that <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Boniface once
came upon a group of Pagans at the Thunder Oak to which
a living child had to be sacrificed every year, and, holding
the Cross in front of the victim told the story of the coming
of Christ. The child was saved, and the Oak destroyed by
lightning, and in its place was seen a young fir tree pointing
with its tall green finger toward heaven. From that time
on Christianity was openly professed, until it has now covered
the whole world.</p>

<p>“Today the observance of Christmas is universal. In
England and America the little folks hang up their stockings
in a row before the fireplace—in France the children place
wooden shoes on the hearth to receive their gifts, and Norwegian
children have a lot of fun hunting their new toys which
have been tucked away in unexpected places. Everywhere it
is above all the children’s holiday.”</p>

<p>“That’s interesting,” said the boy named Billy. “Thank
you and Merry Christmas, Somebody.”</p>

<p>“Same to you Billy Boy,” said Somebody.</p>
